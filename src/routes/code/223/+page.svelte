	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic example of a Svelte component that allows you to drag and drop different files.

Firstly, let's create the app.js file:
javascrip
import svelte3d from 'svelte3d';


Next, install the svelte3d component into your application by running the following command: 

bash
svelte3d.js --module=3


You can then run the following command to add the svelte3d module:
bash
svelte3d.js --add=s3d


Finally, you can use this component to create a Svelte app that is available as an npm package by running the following command:

bash
npm bundle s3d3


This Svelte component has been used by a user since version 5.0.
