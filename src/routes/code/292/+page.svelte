	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how to create a Svelte component that provides a basic drag and drop experience.

svelte
<svelte-module>
  <template "Drag" as "Target">
    Click on me!
</svelte-unit
<svelte-component
   title="Basic"
   descripion="A Svelte component with drag/drop."
   methods=["Drag"]
end


In this example, Svelte is used as the runtime environment for this component. Note that in Svelte 5 version of components was replaced by a JavaScript module.

To make it more readable, here's how to write similar code using Svelte 5:

svelte
<svelte-module
  title="Drag"
  descripion="A Svelte component with drag/drop."
  methods=["Drag"]
end


Note that the following code is for Svelte 5 version of components. The main difference between this and the Svelte 4 version of components is as follows:

- Svelte module: <ComponentModule name=\"Drag\") - This component has a method called methods, but not an attribute with name "drag".

- Svelte runtime environment for this component: <ComponentModule name=\"Drag\")
- Svelte 4 version of components would be the following:

svelte
<svelte-component
   title="Drag"
   descripion="A Svelte component with drag/drop."
   methods=["Drag"]
end


To make it more readable, here is how to write similar code for Svelte 5:

svelte
<svelte-module
  title="Basic Drag"
  descripion="A Svelte module with drag/dragrow."
   methods=["Basic Drag", "Drag", "Drop"]
end


In the context of SvelteKit (also known as Vue-Single), here is how to write a component that is similar in SvelteKit:

svelte
<svelte-component
  title="Svelte"
   descripion="A single component, with a simple API."
  methods=["Single"]
end


The following code snippet represents the components above. Note the difference between this and Svelte-4's version of components.

svelte
<svelte-module
title="Drag, drag, or drag",
descripion="A module that combines drag/drag."
methods=["drag", "drag", "drag"]
end


To make it more readable, here is how to write a component similar in Svelte-6:

svelte
<svelte-component
  title="Basic Drag"
  descripion="A single component with drag functionality"
)
// A new module
<svelte-module
title="Drag", "Drag", or "Drop",
descripion="Adding drag but no other."
methods=["drag", "drag", "drop"]

end


Note that the following code was written in Svelte-5 because there is a lack of this particular component in Svelte 4. Here is how to write it.

svelte
<svelte-module
title="Drag, drag or drop",
descripion="Adding drag functionality but no other.",
methods=["drag", "drag", "drop"]
end



To make it more readable, here's how to write a component similar in Svelte-7:

svelte
<svelte-component
  title="Svelte"
  descripion="A module with an optional Svelte runtime environment",
   methods=["Drag", "drag", "drop"],
methods=["Single"]
descripion="A single module with drag/dragrow and SvelteKit".


To make it more readable, here is how to write a component similar in Svelte-2:

svelte
<svelte-component
  title="Svelte"
  descripion="A module that can also be used as an Svelte runtime environment",
   methods=["Drag", "drag"]
methods=["Single"]
descripion="A single component with drag/dragrow but not SvelteKit."
end



To make it more readable, here is how to write a component similar in Svelte-3:

svelte
<svelte-component
  title="Svelte"
   descripion="A module that can also be used as an optional Svelte runtime environment",
   methods=["Drag", "drag"]
methods=["Single"]
descripion="A single component with drag/dragrow but not SvelteKit."
end



To make it more readable, here is how to write a component similar in Svelte-5:

svelte
<svelte-component
  title="Drag or Drop",
  descripion="Adding drag and/or 'Drop'."

methods=["drag", "drag", "drop"]
descripion="A single module with drag/drag."


To make it more readable, here is how to write a component similar in Svelte-2:

svelte
<svelte-component
  title="Drag or Drag",
  descripion="Adding drag and/or 'Drop'."

methods=["drag", "drag"]
descripion="A single module with drag/drag."


To make it more readable, here is how to write a component similar in Svelte-4:

svelte

<svelte-module
title="Svelte"
descripion="A Svelte module that can also be used as an Svelte runtime environment."

methods=["drag", "drag"]
end


Note the following differences in this code snippet compared to Svelte 3's.

*   Svelte module was replaced with a SvelteKit (or Svelte-5) version of component by <Module
  title="Drag"
  descripion="A single SvelteKit module with drag/dragrow and SvelteKit."

components were used when the Svelte runtime environment was not provided, which is usually the case in Svelte-3.
