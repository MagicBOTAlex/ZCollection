	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a basic drag and drop system. This component includes features such as dragging over the app, dragging into a save feature, saving from the app, quitting the application.

svelte
{s
  title="Drag and Drop System"
}

drag("App")
  .style("Background", "Default")
    .style("Background", "Lighter1")
    .add "App" => [title, descripion] | import { View } = { name: 'view', color: 'red' }, <View title descripion</svelte.3>, <button>Change Text</button>}
{
  $0.style
  {
    ..title
    ..descripion "Drag the following code", .onMenu click document)
}

drag
  class "App" => [drag]
| import { Button } = { name: 'Button', color: 'blue' }, <Button>Change Text</button>, (data text) | 
| import { SqrtBox } = { name: 'Sqrt Box', color: 'orange' }, <Sqrt Box> title "change this", .onDrag click drag), ((drag x, 2)) | 
| Srt("Color") | import { Button, color: 'red' }, (drag x, 1) | 
|}


This component includes features such as the following:

* The drag tag is used to represent a class that can be manipulated using the drag method.
* When you select multiple instances of the drag feature and you click on it once more than dragging in the application will show you how to use Svelte 5. The class tags are below, which include some code snippets.

svelte
class "App" => [drag] | import { Button } = { name: 'Button', color: 'blue' }, .onDrag click () -> (Button button) {
    ..title
    ..descripion "Change this", .onclick begin document)
}



To implement a Svelte component, you would need to use the following code:

svelte
{s
  title="Svelte Component"
  class "Component" => [drag] | import { Button } = { name: 'Button' }, <button>Change Text</button>, (create) | when begin document)
}



To implement a Svelte component, you would need to use the following code:

svelte
class "Svelte Component"
{
  ..title
  ..descripion
  ..title
  ..descripion + 'Drag the following code' => (drag x), .onclick begin document)
}


This is how you would implement a Svelte component.
