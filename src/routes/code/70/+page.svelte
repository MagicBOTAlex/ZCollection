	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic example of how to implement a drag and drop system in Svelte.

Firstly we need to create two components:

svelte
import { storeState, storeValue } from 'svelte/commands';
import { createStoreSilt } from 'svelte/danger-mode/commands/Silt/commands/danger/danger-danger-dub-d-and-6;

// Basic Silt

<silt @on="drag" action="Drag" />


And finally we can add a basic silt component.

svelte
silt @on="drag" action="Drag" {}
<silt @on="drag" action="drift" /> 


Here is the code with some missing things:

svelte
import { createStoreSilt } from 'svelte/danger-mode/commands/silt';

silt @on "drag" action="Drag" {}

silt @on "drift" action="drift" />


Here are the details of a Silt component. It has three attributes:

* @action 
* @on" 
* @on "drill"
                `;
