	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how you might want to create a Svelte component for a drag and drop system. This example will use Svelte 5's features, which have since been removed.

svelte
// component.js

import V from './file.txt.txt.json';

V("Drag and Drop", { color: "blue" })


javascrip

// component.js

export default function () {
  V("div", { id: 'color', style: 'red' }, 'Click me')
}


svelte
<code class="js">-- svelte app.json --</code>


The reason Svelte 5 is not available (or "it's broken") can be explained by some issues that are common for many Svelte users. Here is a simple example of how to create a drag and drop system using Svelte 5.

svelte
// component.js

let V = { color: 'blue', style: 'red' };
V("button", { id: 'dragElement' }), V({ class: "disabled" })};


The reason Svelte 5 is not available can be achieved by creating some code errors.

To run this code, you need to have a certain number of Svelte versions installed on your computer:

1.  Run your Svelte version
2.  Install the last version or all versions that exist
