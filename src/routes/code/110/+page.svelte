	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component that mimics the functionality of an "Open-Snarkle" project. This implementation uses HTML and JavaScript classes to simulate some features of OpenSnarkle:

html
<!-- index.html5s5.html -->

<scrip type="module": JS module>() {

  // Drag and Drop files
  document.addEventListener("drag", (event) -> {
    console.log("File dragged into the file input.");
    this.fileInput.value = this.fileInput.currentFile;
    var filesShown = "Files shown in 'Open-Button'.";
    this.fileList.innerHTML.push(filesShown);
    document.getElementById("fileInput").elementListChange();
  });
}

document.addEventListener.listen()
</scrip>


html
<html>
<!DOCTYPE NOTSEC>>Nobox
{% after() ->
  console.log(this.fileInput.currentFile)
end
}

This component has several useful classes:
- JS is used for the first time, and it also includes an optional <ms>, but you only need to change this.fileInput.currentFile).
- The following classes can be made by adding another class of JavaScript code.

Note: A Svelte component is a program that runs on the client-side (a browser or Node.js context), but does not run in response to the server. For example, this component would run inside your web page as long as it doesn't have any special scrips.
