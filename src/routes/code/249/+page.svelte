	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a simple "drag on the body panel" Svelte component written in Svelte 5.

svelte
<svelteComponentList
 title="Drag on the body panel"
 icon={app}
 state="Open" />
<svelte-Component
title="State with different values than before dragging on the body panel"
icon={drop}
state=""
dragOn
icon="drag on the body panel"/>


This Svelte component is a bit more complicated as it uses several features and attributes.

Here are some important things to note in this component:

*   svelteComponentList is used here for the first time. It was created when Svelte 5 was released, which marked the end of the Svelte year.
*   The components shown have been deprecated since Svelte 3.
*   Instead, we use Svelte.Component (which is also a bit harder to use than the old way), and make it more explicit in this example by adding the <state>. Here's how you can do that:

svelte
<SvelteComponentList state="Open" />


A Svelte component with a few dozen properties. This component has two S (the Svelte components) and one S (the Svelte components).

To make this component more explicit, here is how to add the following <state> as an additional attribute.

svelte
<SvelteComponentComponent
 title="Title"
 icon={icon}
 state=""
 
/>

<svelte-ComponentComponent
 title="Drag on the body panel and drag on a different panel"
 icon={drag}
 state=""
/ svelte/component/>



Here is Svelte 5 for reference. A Svelte component with a few dozen properties. This component has two S (the Svelte components) and one S (the Svelte components).

A Svelte component that is more readable than the old way.

When you are using Svelte, it's worth noting that some of the features will have to be updated in order to write Svelte 5 code.
