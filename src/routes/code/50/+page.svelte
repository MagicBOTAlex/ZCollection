	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic example of how to implement a "drag and drop" system in Svelte 5.

svelte
<div class="drag-drop" @click={drop}></div>

<scrip, scope:]="console"">
  <div class="dropdown" button-out="add" @click={toggle}>Dropdown</button-out="add"></button-down>
</scrip>


In the Svelte component above, we have a "drop" element that is clickable. We also have an "add" dropdown option that can be clicked.

When you run this code in a browser like so:

html
<app @click={toggle} />

<scrip, scope:="console">Drop</scrip>


You should see two elements: div and button. The first is a drag and drop system for the second "Dropdown" element. 

**Code Explanation**

- We have an HTML element with some attributes.
- When we run Svelte component code in browser, this code runs on an Angular component.

To implement this Svelte component, you should understand Svelte's basic syntax:

* sveltecomponent/<name@>
+ <klasses</x>
