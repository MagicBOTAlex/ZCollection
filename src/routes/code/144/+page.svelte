	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a sample implementation of a Svelte component that mimics the functionality of a "drag and drop" system.

dart
// class: DragDropComponent

// extension: @sveltejs Class
class _1() {
  return document.createElement("div", 'div container');
}

// event: DOMUser's Event List
@Svelte(3) run: [] =>
{ }


This component is created by Svelte and can be used as a JavaScript library. To use it, simply add the following code to your application:

dart
app = Documented.from.js("svelte")
    where index: {
        name: "Name"
    };


And here's how you might want to start building this component.

Here is how you can modify the _1 class so that it has two properties, name and id, along with one property classes.

dart
app = Documented.where(
    'The following code will add a new document to its root',
    where: (args) -> 
    { classes = "some classes" },
    class: 2,
),


To add this component to your application, you can use the following code:

javascrip
const _1s = app.split(document.re);
app = Array.from(classes)
    where index: 'classes'
    do class name
    document.where;
app = document.classes
    class: "drag_and_drop" }


Here is how you can modify this component to start building it.

dart
// component creation
app = app.split(document.re).where(includes, 2)).as.map(document.query) where index of aSvelteComponent)

// component updates
document.where('classes');
document.query;
const classes: document.classes
    class: "Class-1" })


This is how you can start building this component.

Here is how you can add some components to your application.

dart
// adding new components
app = Documented.where(
    'The following code will add a new document to its root',
    where: (args) -> 
    { classes = "Class-1" },
    class: 2,
),


To use this component, you can simply add this component to your application.

dart
// using existing components
app = Documented.where(
    'The following code will add a new document to its root',
    where: (args) -> 
    { classes = "Class-1" },
    class: 2,
),


And here's how you can start building your component.

Here is how you can modify this component. Here is how you can use Svelte 5.

To add new components to your application, follow these steps:

javascrip
// creating a document
document = app.split(document.re).where('classes'));
document.query;


And here's how you can start building your component.

Here is how you can modify this component. Here is how you can use Svelte 5.

To add new components to your application, follow these steps:

dart
// using a document-based system
app = app.split(document.re).where('classes'));
document.query;


And here's how you can start building your component.

Here is how you can modify this component. Here are the following statements in Svelte 5.

To use Svelte 4 instead of Svelte 5, you will need to rewrite the codebase at a high level and replace many things that were written in Svelte or Svelte.js.
