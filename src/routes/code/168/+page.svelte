	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component that allows you to drag and drop things into the console.

svelte
<svelte-Component title="Drag and Drop" descripion="Copy of Svelte 3" icon="icon-draw")
  .ariaIcon=[]
  .heading1={10}
  .text body { "Click me to enable the component." }
  Card
button
{
    --console
    {
        -- You can't have a console with multiple icons. It's like trying to make a sandwich on an airplane.
    },
    --icon
    {
        -- Don't count many of those in Svelte 5. Not Svelte 3, as the 2nd name for this very frustrating technology being called "Svelte".
    },
    --console-name-when-somemore-used
    |~ConsoleNameWhenSomework when-sr3
{
    console.log("You can't have a console with multiple icons. It's like trying to make a sandwich on an airplane.")
}
button
{
    --console
    {
        -- You might as well not go in Svelte 5.
    }
},


svelte
<scrip lang="sl-svelte.component"]
var svelteComponent;

svelteComponent.$title = "Drag and Drop" : titleS
{"Console Name When Somework", $sconsoleNameWhenSome}
<scrip scrip lang="sl-3rd"]
"""
 Suggested to use: -x c . console, or run your components.

 The console keyword is short enough that it will be displayed as a warning. Run your components.
."""
</scrip>
<button
  >Console Name When Some< B
{
    console.log("You can't have a console with multiple icons.")
}
 button
[/svelte]


Here's the breakdown of Svelte components:

- Svelte 5 = Svelte. This is short enough that it will be displayed as a warning.

- console log = "You can't have a console, so I am very sad about that.": Run your component.
                `;
