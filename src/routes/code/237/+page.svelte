	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a drag and drop system using the SvelteKit library.

First, you need to add some functionality to your components:

javascrip
import { useState } from 'sveltekit-svelte';

const App = SvelteKit("App", {
  Card,
});



You can now import this component into any Svelte app. 

Here is an example of a "Drag and Drop" components that allow users to interact with the application by dragging files.

javascrip
import { useState } from 'sveltekit-svelte';

const App = SvelteKit("App", {
  Card,
});



To add this component to your app, you can create a new Svelte app:

javascrip
import { makeAppComponent } from "app.js";
export const s = createEl(app());


You can also use the following code to add the component to your application:
javascrip
import s from "app"

const app = s(2) /* 
    create a new Svelte app
  */
createEl(app, 1, { drag: 's', drop: 'd' }));



This is how you would implement the Svelte component.

If for security reasons ensure that the file is in the directory with one master file or multiple.
