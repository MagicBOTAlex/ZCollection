	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a "Svelte component" for those who may have some kind of versioning issues with the ES versions of your browsers:

svelte
<svelte-component name="Drag-and-Drop" />


A simple Svelte component has only two properties: name and type.

svelte
<div class="drag" style="--drag" typeof "browser"">
  <div class="drop" typeof "keyboard" style="--keyboard" { keyboard}0,0} {1}0}>
    <div class="button" native" "command" { command} {
    "Shift+Click"
}
</div>


In this component, the drag and drop elements are both attached to a div element, which is then styled with some CSS.
                `;
</script>

{snippet}
