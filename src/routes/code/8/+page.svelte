	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how to create a Svelte component for a "drag and drop" system in Svelte 5.

First, let's define the basic structure of a Svelte component:

svelte
<svelte-component title="Drag and Drop System" descripion="Drag and Drop: Dragging a file or folder with the drag operation." />


Next, let's create the "Drag" function in Svelte 5:

svelte
<scrip init="drag" @click]
<button>Drag</button>
(click) redirect #drag
{.on click}Drag


This is a simple example to illustrate how to use Svelte. Note that there was a bug in this example because the :scrip element is used for running JavaScript code which is not applicable to Svelte.

In Svelte 5, we can create an "event" or more specifically, a "component" with multiple states and some additional state properties, as well as some extra event types. Here's how you would implement it:

svelte
<scrip>
import { Component } from "svelte-extensions";

const Component = new SvelteComponentModule("Drag", [
  "Click on the button.", ],
  {
    "on click" () : Drag(),
  },
)

<scrip>
{.on click}Drag
</svelte-exports>


As you can see, this is an example how to create a Svelte component.
