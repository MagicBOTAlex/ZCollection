	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component that allows users to drag and drop different types of files or data into designated areas.

Firstly you would need to have two things for this component:

1. svelte-asm: This is the JavaScript source code for your application, which can be included as an embedded scrip in the browser via the deployment notes for Svelte 5, or manually via some HTTP adapter that allows you to embed a Svelte app.

2. svelte-app.json (or .tmp if you're using Svelte App): This is a basic JSON file where you could add this component's JavaScript source code and also where the magic happens.

json
module.js
{
  name = "Drag & Drop System";
  descripion = "A demo for Svelte 5, a drag & drop system.";
}


You can now install Svelte 5 as npm or via npmX:

bash
npm -i package svelte-app@v2.0-1


or

bash
npm -r v svelte app@ v svelte app v3


and then use it in your application.

Here is an example of how to create a component with Svelte 5:

javascrip
import { createApp } from 'comps';
export = null;
const component = new Vms;
if (!component.current)
{
    component.current = {
        createMap,
        createWebPage,
        createDocument2,
        createDocument3,
    };
}
else if (component.current === false) {
    component.current
  .createMap
  .createWebPage
  .createDocument2
  .createDocument3;
}


and then use it in your application.

Here is an example of how to install Svelte 5 as npm:

bash
npm -r v svelte app@ v2-0-1


or

bash
npm --v v c svelte@edge-12


For Svelte 4, use the following command instead:

bash
npx s v3@ edge-12


Note: The installation of both components in this example has been provided with a lot of it.
