	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how to create a Svelte component for a drag and drop system using Svelte 5:

svelte
<svelte-clique draggable="true" on-activate="activate">
  <div draggable="true">Click me</div>
</svelte_clause>

<scrip selscrip="javascrip"></scrip> pair

<scrip src "./draggable.svelte" "draggable" "activate"] {
  $rootEl.innerHTML "Drag and Drop"
}


And here is an example of how to use the Svelte component:

html
<div draggable="true">Click me</div>

<scrip src "./my_svelte_component.svelte"];
<!-- note: a few quotes in Svelte -->
<svelte_x_svelte>drag</svelte>
</svelte>



This code defines two Svelte components. The first one is the component that can be used to create a drag and drop system, it has three attributes: draggable attribute with a value; $rootEl element with attributes in its name; and $rootEl element with a text, which are both Svelte 5 components.

The second one is the same as the first but also includes an HTML block that was added when this component was executed.
