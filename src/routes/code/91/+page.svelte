	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic example of how to create a Svelte component that supports drag-and-drop operations. I will also explain each part of the code.

svelte
<div style="event board" class="content-box"></div>
<scrip>
class ComponentS {
  get events() { return this.events }
  get transitions() { return this.transitions }

  open(event = "open") {
    if (typeof event) {
      console.log("Open the dropdown");
      this.openState(event);
    } else undefined;
  }

  mouseEnter(event = "mouseEnter") {
    document.addEventListener("MouseEnter", "Event")
        .on(this.mouseEnterClick)
        .once this.mouseMove
        .click(this.mouseSvelteClick)
        .once this.mouseDelete
        .once this.mouseClick
        .once this.mouseOpen
        .open(this.openState);
      document.addEventListener("MouseLeave", "Event");

    document.querySelectorElement().addEventListener(
        'mouseHold',
    'Event')
        .once this mouseMoveDown
        .click(this.mouseSvelte)
        .click(this.mouseDelete)
        .once this mouseSelect
        .click(this.mouseClick1, [this.mouseClick])
        .div(this.mouseEnter, this.open, "open"),
        document.querySelectorElement("Mouse), click(this.mouseMove), document.open, "event"],
    'Event",
    (e) => onMouseMove, 
  e);
  }
}

</scrip>


svelte
function mouseSelect() {
  return {mouseClick()}
}


Note: The above code is a simple example for completeness's sake. It is not intended to be used in the production environment.

To use this component, include it in your HTML file or create an Svelte component that can run on every page and may have various extensions:
bash
<my-component></div>


svelte
function openState(state) {
  return state;
}


Please note that creating a Svelte component with multiple features is much more complex than the previous examples. The goal of creating a Svelte component with many features is often to generate an application codebase or a framework for other developers who may have different purposes in their projects.

This example will be used in a real-world project where you might want to create it to test some new ideas or experiment with things that were not intended to be included in the standard Svelte.

If you're interested and willing to continue learning, Svelte 5 includes many features like drag-and-drop, and you could easily combine this knowledge with your existing HTML codebase.

For instance:
bash
<div class="myComponent" content="Open the dropdown")>
  document.addEventListener("Open", "Event")
    .open(this.openState)
    .document.querySelectorElement().addEventListener(
        'Open', 
      'Event'
);

<div style="event board"></div>

<scrip>
class Component {
  get open() {
    return this.open;
  }
}

</scrip>


svelte
return document.querySelector("myComponent", this.content).open(this.openState);
document.addEventListener("Open", "Event");
var events = ["Event"];
return new Component();

</svelte


To create and run Svelte components with multiple features:

bash
<my-component></div>


Replace the existing codebase with Svelte 5.
