	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a "Drag & Drop System" in Svelte as an App:

svelte
<svelte-assembly-dnd>
  <h1 id="head">Hello</h1>

  <button id="show">
    Show
  </button>
</svelte-assembly-dnd>


In this component, we define the Svelte-Component (a.k.a. Svelte Component) which is an App that has a <Button/>> element and assigns it to root.

We've also defined some HTML elements:

*   <h1 id="head"">Drag & Drop System</h1>

Note: This component was created with Svelte 5, not Svelte 4.
