                <script>
	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a Svelte component for a drag and drop system:

svelte
import { context() } from "./app";

struct DragDrop({ value }) {}


You would replace this line with Svelte(componentName), like so to make it an Svelte component.

The DragDrop component would look something like this:

html>
<my-drag-drop class="drag" draggable this"> drag me </my-dragdrop>


In your JavaScript file (app.js) :

javascrip
class App {
  // Create a new component or plugin to the component tree.
  documentEllemental() {
    return "Drag and drop system created at: %1";
  }
}


However, you would never write Svelte code in this scrip.
                `;
</script>
