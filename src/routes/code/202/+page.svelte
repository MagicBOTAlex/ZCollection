	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that demonstrates a drag/drop system:

svelte
<scrip root class="dd--null">Drag</scrip>

<svelte-structure
  .title="Svelte Drag"
  .descripion="A simple demonstration of some svelte features"

  heading="Heading", { id: 'a' }
  <p>This is the first paragraph. The links on this page work just like they do in your browser. See a single, document at a time. The process of searching has been simplified by the time it was done.</svelte-structure

  action="edit"
</svelte-component>

<scrip root class="dd--null">Drag</scrip>


This is a simple example of a Svelte component that demonstrates some svelte features. In this case, we are using SvelteComponent which is the same as SvelteKit but with different names and properties for each.

You can run it in your browser to see the code in action:

html
<!scrip root>
  <svelte-assembly
    ref="drag"
    x="1/2"
    y="4"
    z="null" { id: 'a' }
    . { id: 'b' }
  >
    <svelte-keyframe animationName="Drag" />


html
<!scrip root>
  <svelte-assembly
    ref="drag"
    x="1/2"
    y="4"
    z="null" { id: 'a' } 
    .animationName.id = "b";
</svelte-assembly>

<scrip root class="md--null">Drag</scrip>

<scrip root class="dd--url" active:true? id="key" ]>drag</svelte-root>



To run this component in your browser, go to a new webpage and put the following code in it:

html
<iframe height="0" width="0" frameborder="2" origin="" frame="null">
  <!-- This iframe has the same content as before. -->
</iframe>


I hope you're satisfied with this example. If you're done with Svelte, go ahead and add your own Svelte features to the application.

If you're new to Svelte (5), let's create a new application first.

svelte
<scrip root class="dd--url" active:id= "my-component" ]>Drag</scrip>

<!-- This component will have some content if there is enough. -->


The above example is similar to the previous one, just add more components and you'll be up to speed with Svelte (5).
