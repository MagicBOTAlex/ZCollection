	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a basic drag and drop system. This component will use the same design as it was in version 1.0.

svelte
<svelte-component>
  <!-- This is a wrapper div to hold the content -->
  <div id="content" style="display=none; flex=clock"></div>

</svelte-viewport>


And here is the equivalent Svelte component:

svelte
<svelte-component>
  <!-- The drag zone -->
  <div class="drag-zone" draggable="true" on-click="handleClick" on-drag=> "Click me a div with classes . Click" class="drag"></style>>

<div class="container" style="display=none; flex=clock></div>

</svelte-viewport>


This component uses Svelte's div element to create a drag zone, and includes a container. It also has the same effect as its Svelte 5 counterpart.

If you're already using SvelteKit (the previous name for Svelte), then you can simply use this code:

svelte
import { Component, State } from ".."

component {
    click = "my Drag function"
}

</svelte-kit>


This component has the same effect as in version 1.0 of SvelteKit.
