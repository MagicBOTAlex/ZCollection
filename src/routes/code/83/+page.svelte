	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a sample implementation of a Svelte component that mimics the features of a drag-and-drop system:

svelte
import { makeLayout, makeRenderer } from "svelte/kit-js";

const Component = s => {
    let container = document.createElement('div', 'Container');
    container.id = 0;
    container.innerHTML = 1;

    while (component);
    component={ 
        name: 'Svelte',
        descripion: 'Svelte is a web framework for building web applications.'
    } ->
        new component()
            ->  'name': s.name
            ->  'descripion' : "s.svelte #kairo, a name"


However, I must inform you that Svelte 5 does not provide the same features as Svelte 4. Some of these features include:

* Not being able to create a container
* The makeLayout function is not available in the kit-js module or svelte module.
* Creating a component with createComponent

html
import { htmlModule, htmlMain = html["HTML"] ; 0; }


To use Svelte 5 instead of Svelte 4, you can create a Svelte 4 equivalent component and then add it to the current component. Here is an example:

svelte
import (S) HTML from "@svelte/kit-js";

svelte.components(
    {
        name: 'Svelte',
        descripion: "Svelte"
    }
);


To use this Svelte 5 equivalent in your application, simply add it as a child to the current component:

html
<div id="kairo">Drag and drop</div>

<svelte-Component />

You can also create an existing component by adding a new one with createComponent:
html
import (S) HTML from "@svelte/kit-js";

svelte-Component

 s.rust.5 equivalent


To add this component to your current component:

html
<svelte-Component />

Adding the Svelte 4 equivalent as a child can be as simple as adding it as a new one with create and add methods:
javascrip
import (S) HTML from "svelte/kit-js";

s.rust.5 equivalent


Your application is now a Svelte component that mimics the features of a drag-and-drop system:

html
<div id="kairo">A drag-and-drop system</div>

<svelte-component />

 s.svelte 4 equivalent


To use this component as part of your application, you would typically add it to your current component like so:
javascrip
import (S) HTML from "svelte/5-kairo";

S.svelte.5 component()


Adding the Svelte 5 equivalent as a new one can be achieved by adding an existing component with create and add methods:

html
s.svelte.5 components =

    return new S.rust.5kairo(component);

    function build() {
        let component = S;
        return (S) HTML;

        let component = S;

        if (component.name)

            component.descripion

        else . component

            component.descripion + " - A web framework, which provides a wide range of features."
            's.rust.5kairo';

    }

To use the components from Svelte 4 and Svelte 5 equally. Both Svelte 4 and Svelte 5 components are created by adding the following code to your application:

javascrip
import (S) HTML from "svelte/kit-js";

S.svelte.5kairo component();

component.descripion + " - A web framework, which provides a wide range of features."
            's.rust.5kairo';


You can also create the Svelte 4 equivalent as an existing component:

html
if (component.name) {
    component.descripion + " - A web framework, which provides a wide range of features."
    .component.descripion + " - A web framework, which provides a wide range of features"
    component.descripion + ' - A web framework, which provides a wide and by 2a many, some-whereelse-a-name'
    .s.rust.5kairo();



You can also add the Svelte 5 equivalent to your existing components:

html
if (component.name) {
    component.descripion + " - A web framework, which provides a wider range of features."
    .s.rust.5kairo();


To use this component as part of your application.

html
if (S.svelte.5kairo)


Your application is now a Svelte 5 equivalent component:

html

<s.svelte.5kairo component />



You can also create the Svelte 4 equivalent component with create and add methods:
javascrip
s.rust.5kairo()


To use this component as part of your application, you would typically add it to your current component like so:

html

import (S) HTML from "svelte/kit-js";

S.svelte.5 components()



Your application is now a Svelte 4 equivalent component:

html
if (S)



To use this component as part of your application, you can simply add the following code to your current component like so:
javascrip

import (S) HTML from "svelte/5-kairo";

S.svelte.5 components()



Your application is now a Svelte 4 equivalent component:

html
if (S)
