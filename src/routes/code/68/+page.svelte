	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a "Svelte Component" as you request.

However, I must inform you that writing a Svelte component without a specific Svelte version (e.g., Svelte 3) in mind is quite challenging. Additionally, such components are rarely being created or utilized for anything other than creating new projects and the need to keep changing the tools around us is more important then.

Let's implement this drag and drop system:

svelte
svelte_module = 'drag-drop-system';

function handleDrag(e) {
  console.log('Drag:Click', "Clicked");
}



Create a SvelteModule class with Svelte, which has the following implementation. It is based on Svelte 5.

typescrip
class svelte_component {

render_drag=false;

onclick=changeToYes;
  changeToYes=(s){$s("drag," + "click", null, "file")});

}

mount()=svelte_element.html



Here is a simple component to demonstrate the functionality of Svelte.

html
<svelte_component render="drag" />
<button onclick={this.renderDrag = !this.click?"Open" : "Click"} { 'Click' }} "Click">Click</button>


This code creates three instances:

1. A svelte-element.html file with the following Svelte functionality.

html
<!-- svelte.module -->
<svelte_module name="drag," class="click" />
<button click={!this.click ? "Click" : ' Click' } { '' Click }
Click



This code demonstrates a drag-and-drop system in Svelte.
