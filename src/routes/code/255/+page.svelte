	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a sample code for a Svelte component that demonstrates the basic features of Svelte, including drag and drop.

svelte
import { Component, transition } => null from SvelteKitVue;

const App = sveltekit("app", {
  "drag" : (u) => {
    let element: HTML5VideoElement=u;
    while (element.textContent=="drop") {
      break;
    }
  },
  state : state
);


html
<!-- component -->
App.text("Drag and Drop System");{
  "Drag and Drop System",
}

In this example, we define an Svelte component called App that has the following properties:

*   drag (a property):  This is a string. 
    Example:

    html
<my-donor-don1 class="donor""></sveltekit.app. "Don" />


This component includes all the features of Svelte, including:

*   <--/s> : The transition property.
*   <--/s> : A string.
*   <--/>:  The transition property.

Note that in Svelte, we are not using SvelteKit but instead, a component called App.
