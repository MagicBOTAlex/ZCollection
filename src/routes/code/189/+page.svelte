                <script>
	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte-like drag and drop system in Svelte 5.

svelte
<svelte-component name="Drag-and-Drop" />


This code defines the name attribute of the component. You can then use the following code to interact with the component.

html
<svg
  width="400"
  height="400"
  viewBox "white"
  require "./drag.svg.png"
</svg>


You can also add some interactivity by using Svelte's mouse and key event support.

svelte
<svelte-viewport name="Keyboard" />


Here's how you can drag objects around.
                `;
</script>

{snippet}
