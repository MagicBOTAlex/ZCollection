                <script>
	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component that allows you to drag and drop files into the console.

svelte
<scrip root import "drag" "drop" />
<div class="console" title="drag and drop" />
<div class="input" title="Drag and Drop" />
<a draggable="flip" draggableited="console" draggable="flip"> Drag this</a>
<button on:click start console click>Drop me</button>
<div class="droppr" title="Console" panselectselectall</div>

<scrip root-true
{
  $add 'console' "drag" "drop" "console" "/flip" }
{
  $add 'console' "create" "edit" />
{
  $add 'console' "delete" "open"
}
}

on:click start console click>

<div class="input" title="Drag and Drop files into the console" />
<div class="drag" draggable "flip" />


In Svelte 5, this code would be written as a JavaScript file. Here is an example of what it might look like:

javascrip
import { Component } from svelte- components system;
import { View } from './ view };

const app = new Application({});

const View = {
    title: "Console",
    descripion: "Drag and Drop files into the console"
};

Component.create(app, { title: "drag and drop" }, 1));


This is a simple component with some basic features. To add this code to your Svelte app, you would need to import all components first, then import the view. 

svelte
import { View } from './ view ';
export const console = new App;

app title "Console" descripion


To run this code, create an Svelte component with some basic features.

javascrip
export function console() {
  return App;
}

<console>
    <div class="console" title="Console">
        Create a new App
    </console>
</svelte

To compile and run this JavaScript file in your Svelte app, you would need to import all components first. Then, import the component that was created into your application.

svelte
import { Component } from svelte- components system;
export const console = new App;

console title "Console" descripion

console create a new App

To run this JavaScript file as part of Svelte app, you would need to add it to the top section of your component. Here is how to do that.

svelte
import { Component } from svelte- components system;
import { View } from './ view ';

const mainApp = new Application({});

mainApp title "Console" descripion


To run this JavaScript file in your Svelte app, you would need to import it. 

svelte
export function console() {
  return App;

console create a new App

console console

This is how to compile and run this component of Svelte.

Note that Svelte components are specific and can be used as follows:
                `;
</script>
