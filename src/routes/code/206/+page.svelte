	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte-like drag-and-drop system in Svelte 5.

First, let's import the necessary dependencies:

html
<scrip type="module" src="svelte.js" crossorigin="native" version="1.7-rc3" build_version="1.7.3"></scrip>


Then, here is how you would make a Svelte component that looks like this one if it were not for JavaScript and React instead:

html
<scrip type="module" src="svelte.component.js" />


Here is the implementation of a Svelte component that behaves like a drag-and-drop system in Svelte 5:
typescrip
import scrip, currentTab => {
    let context = "web";
    if (isWeb) return !context;
};
<scrip type="module" src="svelte.component.js" open=4 />


This is the implementation of a Svelte component that behaves like a drag-and-drop system in Svelte 5.
