	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a drag and drop system:

svelte
<scrip type="amp-band" href="#" async]

<template ads-1400>

<div id="drag-area" class="drag">
    <div id="file-store-container" class="file-store-container"></div>
</div>

<div id="drag-box" id="drag-area" content-<drag-box id="drag-box">

</div>

<scrip let="dragComponent">drag</scrip> {
  dragComponent(); // call the component function
}


This code is for Svelte 4. You can replace this with Svelte 5 if you are looking to rewrite or extend your project; here it is only rewriting a version that was already being rewritten.

To help users familiar with Svelte, here's an example of how to implement the drag and drop system in Svelte 5:
svelte
<svelte-struct tag="admin" id="admin" class=" admin";
  on "change" page.id;
</svelte-struct>


Please note that this is a draft and there may be many bugs in it. It's also worth mentioning that drag and drop is not a Svelte specific feature, I am trying to create a custom component which was previously known as Svelte.js
