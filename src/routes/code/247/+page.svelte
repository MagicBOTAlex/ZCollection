	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a drag and drop system. I will use the name "drag" as the component.

svelte
import SvelteKitSvelteScriptElement from "./scrip.svelte";

svelteScript "Drag"
  | DOMPURLClickHandler("click", .2, .3)
    = "Left click on 'Drag' to open a text box."


In this example, DOMPURLClickHandler is an Svelte component that represents clicking on the browser's history by executing JavaScript commands.
                `;
