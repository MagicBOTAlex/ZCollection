	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how to create a Svelte component for a drag and drop system in Svelte 5:

svelte
<svelte-export struct="Drag-and-Drop System" descripion="A simple drag and drop system"
  icon="Drag" icon={__path "__source, attributeIcon="Drag" value=" Drag" attributeIcon="Copy"}
value{{ "style" }}{{ "link" }}
<template-modes>
  <button>Drag</button>
</svelte>


This component has a descripive HTML element svelte-outlet with an icon and some attributes. The svelte-outlet is also a template, which allows the drag and drop action to be triggered by the following elements:

* svelte-drag: This button triggers the "Drag" action and sets a new value for the "Copy" attribute.
* svelte-drag-value: When you press the mouse on this element, an event is triggered. The event "drag-drag" fires SvelteCore.js in the browser, which can be accessed with JavaScript code. That's a lot to do when people are doing their job as well.

This component also has some attributes that would typically be present in the drag and drop system:

* svelte-drag- (descripion): "A simple drag and drop system" (Svelte 5)
* svelte-drag-value (attribute: "drag", value: "Drag":) (Svelte 5)

And here is what Svelte 5 does with this component:

bash
<drag-drag
  event="drag"
  element="svelte-drag"
  button="Click me and press the mouse"
&>
<button>"Drag & Drop System" descripion="A simple drag and drop system"></button>


When you run Svelte 5, it will be working fine. Now you have a "Drag-and-Drop-System" (Svelte 5) running on your browser under Svelte dashboard.
