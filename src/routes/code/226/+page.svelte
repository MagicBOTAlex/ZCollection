	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component for a "Drag and Drop" system in Svelte 5.

First, let's create a basic Svelte component called drag-and-drop.

svelte
<svelte-component module="drag-and-drop" />


Next, we can add some properties to this component. This is where things get really interesting in Svelte. We're not going to use the : bit of their life from 2011-2022, though that was a lot of code.

svelte
<svelte-component module="drag-and-drop", url="https://example.com", url="https://localhost" />


To add some properties, we can override these in Svelte. Let's create an error component to add more meaning and readability to this code.

svelte
<svelte-component module="error", "Error:", { status: 'OK' }}


Finally, we can create a reset component to reset the state of our Svelte components.

svelte
<svelte-component module="reset", url="https://example.com/reset", url="https://localhost/reset" />


That's it for this Svelte 5 tutorial. I hope you've enjoyed these little examples at the end of each Svtue, from Svelte in 2022. Let’s build an application that will allow you to create Svelte and Svelte with Svelte 5.

Here is a simple example of how to use Svelte with Svelte 5:

svelte
<svelte-component module="application", url="https://example.com/application", url="https://localhost/application" />


To finally, our first application. Here it is for that Svelte 5 tutorial. I hope you've enjoyed these little examples at the end of each Svtue in Svelte 4, not Svelte.

In this example, we will use a few key concepts:

* sveltejs: "Svelte" in Svelte.
* component: Svelte component from local Svelte module.

console.log

typescrip
import { View } from './application';

const localApplication = {
  status: 'OK',
};

<div class="application" target={localApplication.url + "class"})></div>


That's a wrap! Thanks for the Svelte tutorial.
