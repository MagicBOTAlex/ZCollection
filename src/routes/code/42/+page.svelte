	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a Svelte component for a drag and drop system.

svelte
<svelte-component name="drag-and-drop-system" text="Drag and Drop system" descripion="Drag and Drop file transfer API")

    create function=>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Enter the file to be dropped into: 'drag.txt''><button>>Drop</button></div>

<scrip
class="Svelte.componentClass"
{"name=dragAndDropSystem})


This Svelte component is a bit more complex as it has two main components, <input> and <button>. The first one is the interface of this system, the second one is the code for the system.

svelte
<scrip
class="Svelte.componentClass"
{"name=dragAndDropSystem,"text=dragAndDropSystem,"descripion=Drag And Drop System")
</svelte


This Svelte component has two main sections. <input> is the interface of this system, and <button>. It is designed to work with Svelte 5.
