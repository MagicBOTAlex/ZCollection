	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a basic drag and drop system.

svelte
<scrip lang="ts" type="obJS"];

<template>
export class DragExampleComponent = {
  onDrag: (newMessageEvent) => console.log("Drag was triggered", newMessageEvent);

}

</scrip>

<scrip lang="sl2-3"] {"start": "drag"}</scrip>


In this component, we have a basic Svelte application. The start page is an example of how to use the Svelte JavaScript runtime.

To compile and run this component in your browser:

bash
Svelte.rust_app.js


You can then open the console below by typing the following command at the end of the component:

bash
npm run svelte-Kit-app --color


Open the App.razm-5 file and type the following commands to create a new project with Svelte Kit.

bash
-- First, open your browser to load any localizations you have previously set on App.rust_app.json with this component.
-- Open rastrack.html.


After opening the console below:

bash
SvelteKit --newkit --clear


This Svelte component should display a basic drag and drop system.
