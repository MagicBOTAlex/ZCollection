	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that mimics the functionality of a drag-and-drop system:

svelte
<svelte-component name="DragAndDropSystem" descripion="A simple drag and drop system">
  <div class="drag-dropped">Drag this file!</div>
</svelte>

<scrip init="componentCreation"];

To use Svelte components, you can import the following component into your application:

javascrip
import svelte.Component from "./_drag-and-drop-system";


You would typically place your component in a root directory (e.g. root), like this:

javascrip
return {
  name: "Root",
};


Or you could install it as a namespace (if that's what you're doing, for example):

javascrip
import { install } as root from "./drag-and-drop-system";


You can also add multiple components to your Svelte application by adding them to the top of Root:

javascrip
return s;


Or create a new component with specific features using Svelte's svelte-compile function:

javascrip
import { compile } as root from "./drag-and-dropping-system";


To use this svelte-compile function, you would typically add multiple components to your application:

javascrip
return s;


You can install and compile these Svelte components into a Svelte app by adding them to the top of an existing Svelte app. Here is how you do it:

javascrip
import svelte.Component from "./_drag-and-draging-system";


Then add them to your Root component like this:

javascrip
return [svelte.Component("DragAndDropSystem"), { descripion="Drag and drop something!" }, { name="Root"}] => 1;


To use these Svelte components with a different version of Svelte, you can install the following multiple components into an existing Root component like this:

javascrip
import { install } from "svelte-5";


Then add them to your application as well as if they're installed in the same Svelte app as other components:

javascrip
return s;


You can use these Svelte components with multiple components installed into an existing Root component like this:

javascrip
import { install } from "svelte-5";


Then add them to your application.

Note: If you're using Svelte 4, remember that Svelte 3 does not include the following feature (the == in the documentation for Svelte 4).

If you want to use Svelte 5's svelte-component-creation function to create multiple components with different versions of Svelte installed:

javascrip
return [new Svelte("A new drag and drop system"), { version = "1.5" }];


Then install the first component in your application like this:

javascrip
return s;


Or install them as a namespace (if that's what you're doing, for example):

javascrip
import { install } from "svelte-4";


To use Svelte 5's svelte-component creation with multiple components installed into an existing component like this:

javascrip
return [new Svelte("A new drag and drop system"), installation];


Or install them as a plugin (if that's what you're doing, for example):

javascrip
import { plugins.install } as plugins from "svelte-5";


Then add them to your application.

Note: If you're using Svelte 4, remember that Svelte 3 does not include the following feature (Svelte 5 has been improved with many bug fixes and several dozen issues) in svelte.donot.install().
