	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a sample implementation of a Svelte component that demonstrates a basic drag and drop experience:

svelte
<svelte-dadium>

<canvas class="dang" aria-scope-content="{'c'.classList['backgroundColor']?.repeat([]).sort().find('rgb(1,2/I2) none') ? ? 4)}></canvas>
<scrip>import S</scrip><button type="button" button-size="8.5rem" class="dang">Drag me while you're in the mood!</button></svelte>
</div>
</canvas>

<button

class="dang"

</button
</svelte-dadium>


Note: Svelte (S) is a JavaScript library that allows you to dynamically create and manipulate code on your page. The scrip> tag at the end of the HTML statement includes the code for S, which has been copied into the web page as follows:

html
import S
</svelte-dadium>


The S (S) is a JavaScript library that can be used with S to create a drag-and-drop experience. Here's an example:

html
<canvas class="dang"></canvas>
<button type="button" button-size="8.5rem"
class="dang"

</button

</svelte-dadium>


The code is quite similar between the two components, I will modify it to make S a bit easier to work with.

html
import (selle-5)

<canvas class="dang"></canvas>

<button type="button" button-size="8.5rem"

class="dang

</button

</svelte-dadium>


You can also use the following JavaScript code instead of S4:

javascrip
var s = document.querySelectorAll(".dang");
s.forEach(function el => el.style.backgroundColor);

s4
</document-notation, {
}


I hope this helps! Remember to always keep your S4 and S5 libraries up to date.
