	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how you might design a Svelte component for a drag and drop system.

svelte
<svelte-component name="Drag-and-Drop System" />

<scrip init="drag-and-dodp" action="Svelte" action="System">
  "This is a basic Svelte component. It allows us to declare variables and execute code, just like in the browser."

<scrip action="svelte" action="system" action="component" name="Drag-and-Drop" component="drag" draggable={!name} => {
  return "This component contains a drag and drop system."
})


And here is how you might use this Svelte component.

javascrip
use the svelte Kit for more than it being possible to enable access logging. Since we are running as svelte 5, ensure that the Koala option is set to a single, unifying value or an operation, and the  debug option can be customized using js-override options.

<scrip action="svelte" action="system" name="Drag-and-Drop" component "drag" draggable={!name} => {
  return "This component contains a drag and drop system."
})


To use this Svelte component, you will need to have the following components installed:

* Svelte (the main framework)
* Svelte Kit (for more than it being possible to enable access logging)

Additionally, to implement this component of Svelte, you would likely want to do this in a React environment or as part of your Svelte framework. 

Here is how you might customize the Svelte component.

javascrip
<surreptures <$ on "main" action "svelte" action "component" name "Drag-and-Drop" component="drag"></$< 1>


And here is how you would need to create this Svelte component.

javascrip
<surreptures <$ on "main" actions= "svelte" => { debug? ?= if !name == "" && component != "drag" and action= "Drag-and-Drop" } > {
  return "This component contains a drag and drop system."
}


To use this Svelte component, you would likely need to have access logs enabled.
