	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a basic drag-and-drop system with some features added:

svelte
import Script from './Script.svelte';
export default (function() {
  let scrip = new Script({
      title: 'Drag and Drop System',
    },
    "The button was clicked",
    { hover: true }
);


To use this component, you would need to create the Script component in your application. The following code is just an example:

svelte
<scrip lang="s">
<Progress status="{2}" size={3} />
</scrip>


However, since Svelte versions 1-3, there is no Script class or similar feature; instead the following Svelte-specific components was created.

To use this component in your application:

svelte
import SvelteKitDragDropSystem from './SvelteKit-Drag-and-Drop-system-Promise';
export default (function() {
  let sdk = new SvelteKit-Drag-and-Dodge-ship("The drag and drop system is working");
    sdk.hover = "Hover" + ' '.capitalize;
    sdk.hovered = "Halted" + ' '.lowercase
});


svelte
<scrip lang="s">
<Progress status="{2}" size={3} />
</scrip>


Note the following differences between Svelte 5 and Svelte 6:

* A new SvelteKit component is created.
* The creation of the component has been changed to create a new Script class.
