	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a drag and drop system.

dart
import"SvelteKit Dart"
as kit;

class DragDropComponent {
  @svelteKit_darowait FileDialog {
    get url() =>
      "math/flyer.dart";
    superUrl = "fly.aug.draft.a";
  }
}


You would have to create this component first in your application then deploy it as a Svelte app by running command npm run s or .s or .dart. 

Also you can use the following code to download files and drag them around on the local file system.
                `;
