	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that allows you to drag and drop file attachments.

svelte
<svelte-Component name="Drag Area" do]="files"
  title=" Drag me if you can "
  icon={ "drag" }
/>


In this code, name represents the first file attached by the user. The Svelte component then displays a message that shows up when the drag and drop is complete.

The icon drag will display the file attachment on the screen after it has been dragged to an object with the text "Drag me if you can".
                `;
</script>

{snippet}
