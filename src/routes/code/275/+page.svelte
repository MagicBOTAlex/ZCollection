	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how you might create a Svelte component for a drag and drop system. This component will have some basic features like draggating, dragging, dropping, hovering.

Firstly we define our component:

svelte
<scrip root class="dragDrop" import="dragDrop"></scrip>


And then we do it again. We add some text to the screen, which in this case is just a simple "Hello World" from the browser console, and set the app document's title to "Svelte App". Finally we call our component out with an array of strings.

svelte
<scrip root class="dragDrop" import="dragDrop">
  <div class="dropdown" style="display: flex; flex-adjustimentransform-children" onclick="addThing(this.value.text1))">
    Add some text to the screen.
  </div>
</scrip>


This is how you might create a Svelte component. This component has four classes:

* class - Add Class"
* document - Add CSS class
* body - Add HTML class
* button - Add Button button
                `;
</script>
