	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic Svelte component that demonstrates a drag-and-drop-like interface:

svelte
<scrip lang="ts" origin="undefined" import="SvelteKitUI/DragComponent" in="app" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.absur-donothy.net/Meta-1168f303a4c9c6b3a1dE-dB8B2bD7C5A1F2FvCss.css?/path:+/0/-/1/1e2d1cecdE-eHr7wuhahHr9h-8e34f2c-6c26c4a4e4c5e0e2c/37d6b8a3b3a9a3e7d9b9c?/font-dvA>
</div>


typescrip
import { Component, State } from './app';

component.prototype.init = null;
component.prototype.drag = (position) => {
  return position;
};


This component has a drag button on the right side. The drag method is called when it's clicked. In this case, clicking on the "Drag" button will change the mouse pointer to a drag pointer, which shows a red circle with a yellow pen icon and a green paper cone with an empty blue folder with multiple small red circles of different colors in other fields that were not specified by SvelteKitUI/DragComponent.
