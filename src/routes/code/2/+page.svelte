	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component that mimics the drag and drop system in Svelte 5. I will assume that you are using Svelte 5 as an IDE, but you can use any drag/drop UI tool.

dart
// DライVAの拡賦ボlocks
class _app {
  // @param "name" "name"
  // @see "drag" "add" "wrap"
  Element {\n}
}


In this code, the @see property @svelte(5) and the @d" property @svelte(4) would be incorrect. In Svelte 5, you use @param, @d, @s or other similar properties to add a parameter or access to save, and if you're using a drag/drop system where you have multiple items you can modify the component with the item being modified as well as any secondary parameters.

If you want to get rid of that, here is Svelte 5 code:

dart
// Create your app in Vc.
var App = new Vent('vc);
// Create a new tab and tab.
var Tab = new Vent("Tab", "add")
  .add();

// Update the state with the given data.
var State = new Vent(" state", "name");
State {\n}


To update existing tabs.

dart
// Create a new tab and tab, if we have multiple items that you can remove the component when you are no longer using Svelte 5. 
var Tab = new Vent('vc');
Tab {\n}


If you want to be able to modify this component in Svelte 4:

dart
// Create a new state.
var State = new Vent(" state", "name");
State {\n}
// If this is the first time your state was created, then here's how to update existing states
if (updateExistingStates) {
    // If you are updating multiple items that you can add or remove by adding or removing a new item.
    if (addOrRemoveState) {
        // If this is the first time your component was updated.
        if (addMultipleItems) {
            // Add 10,000 to the state's value.
            add(this "vc", "name");
        }
        else .map(x).where(NotInSvelte), {&x}
    }
} else .if (noUpdate).

// If this is a first time your component was updated
State {\n}


If you want to use Svelte 5's @s property to add or remove items in a state.

dart
// Create a new state and add or remove item.
var State = new Vent(" state", "add");
Svelte 5 code:

dart
// If this is the first time your component was updated.
var SvelteState = new Vent('vc', 'name');

// Add an item to the SvelteState, if you are adding and removing.
Svelte 5 code:
 Dart
var State {\n}


If you want to use @s with some items in a state.

dart
// Create a new state and add or remove items that you can modify by updating this component.

var SvelteState = new Vent('vc', 'name');
Svelte 5 code:

 Dart
var State {\n}


If you want to be able to create multiple components in Svelte 4:

dart
// Create a new state and add or remove items that you can modify by updating this component.

var SvelteState = new Vent('vc', 'name');
Svelte 5 code:
 Dart

// If you have multiple items that you are modifying the component with some of these parameters

var SvelteState = new Vent(" vc", "name");
Svelte 5 code:

 Dart
// Create a new state and add or remove items that you can modify by updating this component.

var SvelteState = new Vent('vc', 'name');


To update existing components in Svelte 4: 

dart
// If this is the first time your component was created.
Svelte 5 code:


// Create a new state and add or remove items that you can modify by updating this component.

var State = (s) => { state {\n} };


This is Svelte 4. You are currently only creating multiple components in Svelte 5. In order to create a true drag and drop system, you need to use Svelte's @s with the new component creation parameters. Here is an example of how to modify this component:

dart
// Create a new state.
var State = (s) => { s {\n} };

// If this is the first time your component was created

var s;


To update multiple components in Svelte 4.

 Dart
// Create a new state and add or remove items that you can modify by updating this component, if you have multiple items that you are modifying the following code:

dart
// If this is the first time your component was created.
Svelte 5 code:
var State;

// If this is a first time your component was updated

s.State {\n}


To update existing components in Svelte 4.

 Dart
// Create a new state and add or remove items that you can modify by updating this component, if you have multiple items which you are modifying the following code:

 Dart
// If this is the first time your component was created

s.State {\n}


To update existing components in Svelte 4.

 Dart
var s;
s.State;


If you want to be able to create a single drag and drop system from multiple drag and drop systems.

 Dart
// Create a new state that is equal in all three places except for the third item

var s;
s.Sent();

// If this is the first time your component was created.
Svelte 5 code:


// If you have multiple items that you are modifying this component, if you want to be able to create a single drag and drop system.

s.State;

// If you want to be able to modify multiple components in Svelte 4
var s;


To update existing components in Svelte 4. 

 Dart

// Create a new state that is equal in all three places, except for the third item

var State = (s) => { s };


If you want to be able to modify multiple components in Svelte 4.

 Dart
// If this is the first time your component was created
Svelte 5 code:

// Create a new state and add or remove items that you can modify by updating this component, if you have multiple items that you are modifying the following code:

 Dart

// If you want to be able to create a single drag and drop system from multiple Svelte 4 components.

s;

s.Sent();


To update existing states in Svelte 4: 

 Dart
// Create a new state and add or remove items that you can modify by updating this component, if you have multiple items which you are modifying the following code:

var State = (s) => { s };


To update multiple components in Svelte 4. 

 Dart

// If you want to be able to create a single drag and drop system from many Svelte 5 components.

s;
