	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that provides a drag and drop system.

svelte
<svelte-component title="Drag and Drop System" />


And here is the implementation:

svelte
<scrip root>
import DragButton from './DragButton.js"
from SvelteKit.DragArea;

let props = {
  class: "Drag Button",
};

</scrip>

<scrip root onMountAction = "add">
  <div class="drag-button"></div>
</scrip>

<scrip root.onMounted = "init" => {
  let dragDropStatus = "Initiating"
}

</svelte Kit


And here is the implementation for SvelteKit (SvelteKit): init event handler. 

svelte
<scrip root>

let props = {
  class: "drag-button",
};

</scrip>

<scrip root onMounted = "add" => {
  let dragDropStatus = "Added";
  return add: dragDropStatus;
};


To use this Svelte component, you would create it in JavaScript and then add the class to a DOM element. Here's how you can do that:

svelte
<svelte-component title="Drag and Drop System" />,
{
  'class': "drag-button",
  'id': 'dragButton',
},
</svelteKit>


It's worth noting that SvelteKit is currently supported in the following browsers:

- Internet Explorer 10 and above: CSS3 Pre-sharoence features
- Opera (and did not work) with all 18.1.5 versions of IE 8.0a

SvelteKit for Svelte 5 support are available in some IDEs at runtime but by default can access the following URLs:

* https://market.sentry.app.op/90 : You can access the market by running the following command:
bash
ske  --drop-d


Here is how you can do that:

svelte
<svelte-component title="Drag and Drop System" />,
{
  'class': "drag-button",
  'id': 'dragButton',
},
<sveltekit>
</svelteKit>


You are currently running SvelteKit.
