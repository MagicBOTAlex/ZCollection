	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a Svelte component that mimics the classic drag-and-drop filetransfer system:

svelte
<scrips = [
    { text: 'Drop me!' }, 
    { dragDataText: 'Drag data' },
    { dropDownData: 'Drop down data' }
];

// panel: title="drop me!";

<!-- panel -->
/* component */
export default SvelteComponent;


html
<svelte-component (title = "drop me", dragDataContent = "drag me")> 
  Drop me!
end>

The scrip function is used to create the component. The svelte code snippet creates a new Svelte component with two attributes, one of which is the title. The second attribute is drkDragDrop.

html
<svelte-component (title = "drop me", dragDataContent = "data")> 
  Drop me!
end>


The SvelteComponent is a simple Svelte component that creates two elements, both of which are labeled with the text. This component was created in Svelte 5.

Note: As Svelte components, this code can be easily shared across an application and used as a starting point for other projects.
