	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component for a drag and drop system. This implementation uses the svelte API which can be used to create new components.

svelte
import v from "../svelte.js?js/index" where v;


This component has two classes: index.svelte, and the main class, "main" is "index.svelte". 

The Svelte framework is created by default when calling v(index.svelte).class on the top level. In this example the index class is "svelte" with no arguments and it's called using the name of the component.

svelte
v('div', { class: 'class' })


The v() component will wrap each div in your application, so you'll have to define your own HTML inside the components before wrapping by Svelte. The component is a bit too small for this example due that Svelte has not supported some of the features like CSS styling on the page since version 4.

In case you wanted to run the component with Svelte 5 you can use the following command:

bash
svelte.devKit.js --debug my-component --features= "index" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8


The command has two options it's a simple command and an option.

A --extension switch allows Svelte to automatically add some features that can be included with a custom application if you have made sure that the extension is not installed. 

bash
svelteKit v('index') class (.*) .*.mycomponent --debug my-component --feature= "drag" - "drop" 2


You can run v(index.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8) with Svelte 5 command.

bash
svelteKit v('index') class (.*) .*.mycomponent) debug my-component --debug mycomponent --feature= "drag" - "drop" 2 


You can run v(index.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8) with Svelte 5 command.

bash
svelteKit v('index') class (.*) .*.mycomponent) debug mycomponent --debug mycomponent --feature= "drag" - "drop" 2 


You can run v(index.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8) with Svelte 5 command.

svelte
// index.svelte


Here is a simple example of how to use the index component in Svelte 5:

bash
svelte-kit v('index').class({ class: 'drag" "drop", 2 }))


You can run v(index.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8) with Svelte 5 command.

svelte
// mycomponent

                `;
</script>
