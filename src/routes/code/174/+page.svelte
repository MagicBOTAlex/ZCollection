	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that mimics the classic drag and drop system:

svelte
<svelte-dcterial name="My Drag") { .1 }
<slink name="my droe", name="dod"): "div", class: 'Svelte.Drag'}


This component will have two classes, MyDrag and MyDroe, since Svelte 5 does not support drag and drop.

html
<div class="s-drag" require="A-D") { .1 }
    <h2 class="d-d">drag</h2>
</div>


The code above is written in Svelte 3.0. The component is Svelte.Drag, which has a drag class named myDroe and a drop class named "drag".
