	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component that allows you to drag and drop objects. I will assume that you want to create a Svelte component for dragging.

svelte
import { makeObservable } from "./base";

makeAccessibleDrag = (name) -> {
    name = "drag"
    descripion = "Slove a large text value, like 'Hello' or 'hello' in the main context.";
};

onMount = () -> {
    console.log("Component activated.");
};


And here is an example of how to use this component. You have two buttons, one for dragging and one for dropping.

svelte
import { makeAccessibleDrag } as drag from .components.drag;
let drag = drag(name);
drag.descripion = "Slove a large text value, like 'Hello'."


You can attach the dragged object to either of the following elements. You have two buttons where you are adding one button each time you press or run the program.

svelte
import { makeDraggable } as draggable = .components.drag;
let dragger = drag;

drangarButton = "drag"

drangarButton.descripion =
  "A little bit of a Svelte component with some options." +
   "Slove this, it's an optional Svelte component that you can choose from."
+ (draggable.descripion) + (describe) ?&quot; dragger


To demonstrate the components provided in the code above, here is how to create two additional elements. You have a drag button and I'm dragging the button.

svelte
import { makeDraggable } as dr
 from .components.drag;
let dr = drag;

draggable = "drag"
  "descripion" + (describe) ?&="draggable


This is how to access this component. Here is how you can attach your drag object to either of two buttons.

svelte
import { makeAccessibleDrag } as dr
 from .components.drag;
let drag = dr;

drag = "drag"
  descripion

+ (describe) ?="drag" 
drastically with one button in the way.


This is how you can access this component. Here's an example of how to create a Svelte component for dragging.

svelte
import { makeAccessibleDrag } as dr
 from .components.drag;
let dr = dr;

if (you want to enable drag), do it, and if I can:

Slove a large text value, like 'Hello' or 'hello' in the main context of "A small Svelte component with some options.".

makeAccessibleDrag,

  descripion


This is how you can use this component. You have two buttons, one for dragging and one for dropping. And I'm glad that you have created a Svelte component to go along with those buttons.

Here's an example of how to create a Svelte component that allows you to drop things by dragging.

svelte
import { makeAccessibleDrag } = .components.drag;
let dr = dr;

if (you can enable drag), do it, and if I can:

Slove a large text value, like 'Hello' or 'hello' in the main context of "A small Svelte component with some options."
descripion.


madeAccessible



So you are ready to go.
