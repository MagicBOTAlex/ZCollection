	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how you might create a Svelte component for a drag and drop system.

svelte
<div 
  class="drag-drag"
  style="draggable"
  on: hover = .self.name + " was dragged into this element by <App> at 'app'</div>
<scrip init="myName" deferred={[]} string[]></scrip>


In Svelte 5, the S component would contain an event that can be activated and saved when it's not being used. The component is then defined as a class with some properties added or removed to the component.
                `;
</script>

{snippet}
