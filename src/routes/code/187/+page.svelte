	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a "Svelte component" that you can use as a starting point for creating your own drag and drop system.

svelte
<scrip type="javascrip">
import { dragDrop } from 'drag-donates';

let myMap = new Map;

dragDrop("Map Component", "add button", "text", 1, () -> {
  console.log("Component");
});


Note that Svelte is a different name for the same technology as React. This is due to the fact that both Svelte and Svelte.js can be used as components or APIs.
