	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a sample implementation of a Svelte component for a drag-and-drop system in Svelte 5.

svelte
<svelte-Component name="drag-drobbel", id="drag-dubbbah" />
<scrip>
  export var dragging = true;
</scrip>

<s v="{ dragging: dragging, colors: 'blue', size: 'red' }, @]


In this code, dragging is a state that tracks whether the user is dragging or not. The colors object is assigned to this state in Svelte 5.

javascrip
{
  dragging,
}
</s>


To use this component:

css
:root {
  // add size if specified
  $size = 'medium';
}


and Svelte 4 code:

svelte
<s v-if={isDragging && onColor === 'blue' ? dragging : null , 'red', colors} />
<s v-if={isdriving ? driving : notDriving ? }
</s>


In this code, driving is a state that tracks whether the user is driving or not. If you are using Svelte 4, you can access this state by chaining the $ operator.

javascrip
{
  $driving,
}


and Svelte JavaScript code:

javascrip
<scrip>
  export var dragging = { $dragging };
</s>

<s v-if={isDriving ? driving : notDriving ? , }
</s>

<scrip>
  export var dragging = { $driving };
</s>

<scrip>
  { isDriving = !! this. 'drive' }
}, 
<s v-if={isNotDriving ? drive : '' , } />


In Svelte JavaScript code:

javascrip
<scrip>
  // assign the driving state
  const driving = this.$driver !== null;

  // check if not-driving and display
  { color: !this NotNotDriving, display }
}, 
<s v-if={isDriving ? drive : '' , }></s>



To use this component:

css
:root {
  $driving,
}


and Svelte code to modify the isDrving state:

javascrip
<scrip>
  // check if drining and display
  { isDrving = !! this.Driving };
</s>

javascrip
<!-- check if notDriving -->

<s v-if={isNotDriving? drive : '' , } />


In Svelte 5 code:

svelte
<s v-if={dragging: dragging }, @] {
  // check if the user is not a driver
  { $notDriving = !this. 'drive' }
}
<s v-if={isDriving? drive : '' ,} </s>



To use this component:

css
:root {
  // add size if specified
  $size = 'small';
}


and Svelte code to modify the isDriving state:

javascrip
<scrip>
  export var dragging = { $notDraining };
</s>



In Svelte JavaScript code:

javascrip

<s v-if={isNotdriving? driving : driving, ,} />

To use Svelte code to modify the isDrifting state:

javascrip

<scrip>
  { isDrifting = driving; }
</s>



To use this component:

css:root {
  // display color if specified
  $color = !this.$notNotDriving && this.$draining;
