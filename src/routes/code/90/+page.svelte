	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how you might create a Svelte component for a drag and drop system:

svelte
<svelte-component name="Drag Drop" described-by="Drag and Drop"],
    { name } = name.name,
    { id } = { id: 'id' }
]


You would then want to add this Svelte component as an attribute to the document, which is automatically added by every Svelte application:

svelte
{ name }, { id } }


This is a basic example of how you might create and configure components in Svelte. There are many more features that Svelte will offer over time.

If you want to customize Svelte's component creation, there are some things to note that can be done:

* By adding the following Sizzle attribute:
sizzle
{ name.name } = { name: 'name' },
    { id.id } = { id: 'id' }
]
- A great way to customize your components, especially if you're building in some other frameworks.

If you want to add some custom attributes:

svelte
{ name.name }, { id.id }


You can also use Svelte's add and add with a value to create an attribute that was created by the user.
