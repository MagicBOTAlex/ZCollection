	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a Svelte component for a drag and drop system:

dart
import sveltekitlang.js from.../file_1.json;
import sveltekitlangjs from ../file_1.json;

svelte.runscrip(1) {
    createMenu true;
    makeMenu false;
}



Here is the implementation of a Svelte component. This code will be added into the HTML file.

html
<!-- index.html -->

<svg
  d="d"
  r=".r"
  c="c" data-color=red
  class="s".s", "name" "n", "name", "text");
attributes
return
element.name
];


Here is a basic Svelte component that runs on a single color:

html
<!-- index.html -->

<svg
  d="d"
  r=".r"
  c="c" data-color="red"
  class="s".s", "n", "f"]


To run this code, make sure you have an Svelte app installed. If you're not using an existing Svelte project, or running more than one Svelte app, then it can't be used as the root of the app. You are assumed to already be signed in on the page.

If you want to add a new Svelte component and run it without creating any existing Svelte projects, follow these steps:

1. Run your current Svelte project.

2. Make sure you have an Svelte app installed. If you're not using an existing Svelte project, or running more than one Svelte app, then it can't be used as the root of the app. You are assumed to already be signed in on the page.
