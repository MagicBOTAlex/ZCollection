	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component for a drag and drop system. This component will have two buttons that users can click on to trigger the drag and drop operation.

svelte
import { createState, createUpdateState } from 'svelte-assembly-dts';
import svelke from '.';

create(0, [true, ['drag', 'drop'], [click], [hover]]), 1);

document.body.create(10, []);


Note: Svelte-Assembly is a JavaScript library that provides the same features as other drag and drop systems. However, it requires manual execution of all JavaScript code to create an event in your browser. That way you can add functionality or implement logic only if your users did not specify whether their own browser history should be deleted after a GET request.
