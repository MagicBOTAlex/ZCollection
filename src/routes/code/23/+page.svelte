	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how you could create a Svelte component for a "Drag and Drop" system.

Firstly, let's create the following component:

svelte
<svelte-component name="drag-and-drop-system" />


And here is what the code might look like:

svelte
<scrip lang="v"]
import App from 'SvelteKit.app'

<svelte 3kit app
  title="Drag and Drop System"
  descripion="A simple Svelte component that demonstrates basic Svelte components. "

</svelte]


And here is what the code might look like:

svelte
<svelte 3kit
  "Create a new Svelte component."
  "Use the following lines to create the component."

<scrip>
  // Create a new app.

</svelte>


You can use this Svelte component as a starting point for any project that requires creating custom components. Just remember to always include all necessary imports and CSS files at the top of your HTML document.

If you're using SvelteKit, here's how you create it:

bash
<scrip
  lang="v" type="function"
  class "svelteComponent"
/>
<svelte 3kit app
  title="Drag and Drop System"
  descripion="A simple Svelte component that demonstrates basic Svelte components. ."

</svelte>


With that, if you run this code in a modern browser like Chrome or Opera, it should create the following HTML:

html
<svelte-component name="drag-and-drop-system" />
<div id="myElement">Drag and Drop</div>

<sveltekit app

  <scrip>
    // Svelte 3.0 can be used as a callback too.
    // But don't use this code in your production application.

  </scrip><a href="https://svelte.dev/api/beta" target="https://devexpress.io " onclick= "app</sveltekit>

  <p id="myElement">Drag and Drop</p>
<div class="drag-and-drop-system"></div>


You can see Svelte components work by following these steps:

1. Create a new component.

2. Update the component's HTML to make it look like the real world.

3. Use the following lines of code as follows, create an element with similar IDs.

html
<sveltekit app</svelte>


You can use this Svelte component as a starting point for creating custom components that are compatible with many Svelte frameworks.
