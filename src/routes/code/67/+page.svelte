	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a drag and drop system:

svelte
<html>
  <scrip type="paper" content-attention="center">
    <p-Drag-and-drop</p>
  </scrip>

  <scrip type="Svelte"] {
      $ = 'drag'
         'drag': $["Drag", "add", "move a certain action"], [
     "name": "name",
   }, "$. dragging", ["undo": function("undo"),], []
        }
          .replace('.Svelte.element()[]->drag', "drag")
    }

</scrip>

This component is a simple Svelte component that adds a drag feature to the program.

To implement this in an application like Svelte 5, you would need to import SvelteKit, which allows for some form of custom code on the web. You can do this with the following command:

bash
--Svelte 3
 npm package:node-svelte:builds:namere.json -c.js.d

--Svelte 4
 npm package:package:main.json -svelte-3 build tags, classes, and modules in scrips

However, SvelteKit is a wrapper for the client-side APIs that you're currently using. For example, if you're writing an application like Svelte 5 using scrip elements or HTML elements from scrips of the following types:

bash
<web application name>@javascrip:API call


To install SvelteKit in an application like Svelte 3, follow these steps and then run it with the following command:
bash
npm package:package:namere.json -svelte-3 build tags, classes, and modules in scrips

If you're currently running a web application in Svelte 5 using scrip elements or HTML elements from scrips of the following types:

bash
<https://sveltejs.js/.import("SvelteKit", window)@version=1.0.3-3-4}


Or if you're currently compiling SvelteKit into a web application in Svelte 5 using scrip like this:
bash
npm package:package:namere.json -sveltekit-3 build tags, classes, and modules in scrips

To run it with SvelteKit:
bash
--Sveltekit


To install Sveltekit into your application:
bash
--app
npm add app to a command


Here is some sample data:

svelte
<scrip type="paper" content-attributes="add", "remove", "undo", "name" -> "drag" | "$. dragging" | ["undo"]-> "drag"]

To install Sveltekit into your application:
bash
--app
npm add app to a command


This is a simple implementation of Svelte 5, which can be extended and in some cases can also have more complex features.

Here is how you can use it:

bash
svelte Kit
 npm package: package:namere.json -svelte-3


If the above two examples do not work with Svelte 5, this scrip will need to run at least one web application in an environment like that.
