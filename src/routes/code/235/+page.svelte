	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that mimics the functionality of a "drag and drop" system:

svelte
<svelte-component name="drop" descripion="Drag a file onto this element."
{ text }<a href="https://www.sv-5.org/r/3/index.html5n" target="/drift">DRM</a></svelte>

<scrip suture>
{s- "Please enable the following scrip to help Svelte ecosystem"
{sister
    {"version": 1.8}
}
<scrip sutter]


This is a relatively simple Svelte component, it's designed to mimic Svelte 5 and not Svelte 4. In Svelte 4 you would call s- the first argument of a scrip that defines an element, and $- the last argument of a scrip that does the opposite.
                `;
</script>

{snippet}
