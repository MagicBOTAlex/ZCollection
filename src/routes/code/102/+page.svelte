	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic Svelte component that mimics the classic drag and drop file transfer experience:

svelte
<svelteKitArea class="drag-fly" draggable="" title="Drag-Fly" icon="f-3g" iconOptions={"a" : { "style": 16 , "height": 1 }}}"></svelte>


This component has a div element with an icon that appears to be dragging. The SvelteKitArea class has three classes: icon,  (if you're using JavaScript), and iconOptions. It's also interactive, as shown in the code snippet.

html
<sveltekitArea.div 
  "Drag-fly" "Fly" "f-3g" 

title="Drag-Fly"
icon={f.f}(a)
} />


To use this component in SvelteKit:

svelte
import App from './app.sveltektarea'

AppMountent()

<div class="kite-kitesky">Svelte</div>


Note: The dr (drag) and c (copy) components were incorrectly named and have been updated.
