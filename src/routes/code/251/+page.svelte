	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a basic drag and drop system.

svelte
<scrip lang="slittle.svelte">import DragDropComponent</scrip>

<svelte-attribute-list>
  {{ Dropping, please! }}
</svelte-attribute-list>


svelte
<struct-drags-drag="handle" draggable on="click"]

  <button-button name="drag" .on "click" "start" .value drag = 'red'}

    <text-field name="name" .on "change" "label" .class)

      {{ start a drag-and-drop experience! }}
</svelte-attributelist


This component includes:

* A svelte-attribute-list to display the text of the dragged object. This is a simple, modern example of how to implement such in Svelte 5.
* svelte-drag and <text-field-drag.drag@drag>

However, since there is no "Svelte 4" version available (as of Sveltekit), we can create our own drag/drop system:

svelte
<svelte-attribute-list

name="drag" .on "click" "start"

textfield<drag name="label", name=, 'red'>

drag

  <button-button class="drag" on-click="move" start></button-button>
  {{ droppin, please! }}
</svelte-attributelist


This component includes:

* A svelte-attribute-list that displays the current state of a Svelte component.
* This is a very simple, modern example of how to implement such in Svelte 5.

Please note that this example was created by Svelte's creator and still widely known as the browser, and not Svelte 4.
