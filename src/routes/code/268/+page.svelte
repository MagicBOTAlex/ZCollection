	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic example of how to implement a "drag and drop" system in Svelte with Svelte 5.

Firstly, you would need to have two files:

main.js which should be implemented as the entry point of the application. It will load the components.

slink.js which is an open-source JavaScript editor developed by Apple. This document was written by Ryan Mc, on December 2, 2023, at a party called Xp. The host for the event was Svelte 3. If you were going to implement a similar drag and drop system in Svelte, but without knowing how or why, then it's time to move over.

slink.js
import (clipping) - app

The previous code is not intended to be used as a template for any web engine. 
It includes scrips that are executed by the client-side scrip on a page and server-side scrips that execute an application by all the browsers in them, including those below, with Web Workers.

To interact with Svelte 5

                `;
</script>

{snippet}
