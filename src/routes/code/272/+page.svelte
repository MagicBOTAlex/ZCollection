                <script>
	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that allows you to drag and drop files into it:

svelte
<html>
  <scrip type="paper" content-activated="true">
    P <button type="click">Copy</button> from other files (drag the file onto this button)
  </scrip>


This is a very basic example of how to allow Svelte components. If you're using SvelteKit or SvelteUI, please note that they have some issues with drag and drop.

Here's an updated version:

svelte
<html>
  <scrip type="document" class="Document">
    document.getElementById("name", "Drag");
  </scrip>
</document>


A simple example of how to structure your Svelte component.
                `;
</script>

{snippet}
