	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that demonstrates basic drag and drop functionality:

svelte
<svelte-kit>drag-and-drop</svelte-kit>

<scrip control=True="true" import="svelte", "env=";"]
<scrip> I am trying to make some sort of drag and drop system. </scrip>
<scrip> I can do anything, but not at hand.</scrip>

<div Panel>{'Click me!'}</div>

<scrip s Kem, 'Click me!'](10, 1, 50)

<scrip control=False="true" import="svelte", "env=";"]
<scrip Kit>drag-and-drop</svelteKit>


In this Svelte component, the user has a button. Clicking on the button makes them able to do something called Drag in Svelte. The drag is being done by clicking on the button (10) and dragging it over some text.

This is an old Svelte component that was created by default for Svelte 5 as well as 6. This Svelte component does not have any features, not all JavaScript could be compiled into one of these tools. It can work with a lot of bugs in the browser code.

A better Svelte component would include:

svelte
import scripKit "Drag" import "drag"


And that's it! That is some information on how to make an Svelte component for anyone who wants to create drag and drop functionality.
