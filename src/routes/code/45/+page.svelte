	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component for a drag and drop system. I will use Svelte 5 as the programming language.

dart
// A simple drag and drop system
svelte Kit {
  const drop = () => this.elementRef?.addEventListener(this.elementName, (e) => e ? e ? 'drag' : 'drop');
  else drop;
}

export let element_name "Drag and Drop System"


Please note that Svelte has a lot of functionality out of the way. This means you have to add lots of extra code.
