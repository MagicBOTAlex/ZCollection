	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that mimics the classic drag and drop experience:

svelte
<svelte-export struct "drag" { => {
  console.log("Drag")
  return "You can drag this file into our JavaScript code."
} on Mount;


This Svelte component has a similar structure to many other drag and drop systems. The svelte-export-struct struct exports the component as a function, but with an additional .mount() method that allows you to perform actions on the component, such as:

svelte
<my-drag>drag</my-drag>


Or, if your Svelte 5 application uses SvelteKit, here is how you might create one of these drag-and-drop features.

First off, let's make sure that your browser and SvelteKit are in the same directory. You probably have them installed as a global module via npm or mzs; for example npm:pkg-install SvelteKit, if not:
bash
-- The "initial" page is different from every other page.

That's right, it's easy to install your SvelteKit app on one's web server and run a command like that.

Next, you need to download the SvelteKit app as an SvelteKit app. Here's how: 

bash
-- First create a branch in your SvelteKit app for the new feature.
-- If that's not possible, go to SvelteKit; install SvelteKit on the server with the following commands:

SvelteKit@3 npm -g SvelteKitnpm out=dist --or-n SvelteKit run "install" install


bash
-- Then do this branch:

git clone SvelteKit-5@2 npm-communumout.npm SvelteKit-5@4 npm-out npm-communumout


Here's how you can use Svelte 3 to run a command like that on your first server.

That's right, it's easy!

bash
-- First create a branch in your SvelteKit app for the new feature.
-- If you're running SvelteKit; require "init" command. See the following commands below.


bash
-- Then do this block:

svelte-2@3 npm run "npm" arg


Here's how to create a drag in the component, and make it draggable.

First off, let's define our Svelte 5 application as a function:
bash
-- If you're running SvelteKit; require "init" command. See the following commands below.


Then do this block:

bash
-- Create a my-drag component
{
  scripName = 'npm';
  runCommand;
}


Here's how to create an Svelte 5 application that includes dragging, and make it drag in the component.

First off, let's define our Svelte 5 application as follows:

bash
-- If you're running SvelteKit; require "init" command. See the following commands below.


Then do this block:

bash
-- Create a my-drag function that is also drag-in-the-component and drags a feature in our component.
{
  runCommand;
}


Here's how to implement the code you created with Svelte 5.

That's right, it's easy!

bash
-- First create a branch in your SvelteKit app for the new component.
-- If that's not possible, go to SvelteKit; install SvelteKit on the server with the following commands:

svelte-3@2 npm run "npm" arg --or-n SvelteKit npm out=dist --or-n SvelteKit
git clone SvelteKit-3@2 npm-out npm-communumout.com.git
-- First create a branch in your component.


Then do this block:

bash
-- If that's not possible, go to SvelteKit; install SvelteKit on the server with the following commands:
git run "install" require


And here is how you can use it.

That's right!

bash
-- First create a branch in your component.


Here's how to implement the code you created with Svelte 5, and make it drag-drag this feature.

First off, let's define our SvelteKit app as follows:

bash
svelte-3@4 npm run "npm" arg "--or-n SvelteKit --if; require npm run "install" install; runCommand; require


Then do this block:

bash
-- If that's not possible, go to SvelteKit; use this command.


Here's how you can create a drag-in-the-component feature with Svelte 5.

First off, let's define our SvelteKit app as follows:

bash
svelte-2@3 npm run "npm" arg ["npm"] arg --or-n SvelteKit --if; require npm run "install" install; runCommand; 


Then do this block:
                `;
