	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that demonstrates a basic drag and drop system:

svelte
<sveltekit-dynamic-links-changed />


This code creates a simple Svelte component with some links. The component will display the following content at the specified link URLs.

html
<scrip type="module":js->0>
<scrip s-compile="dynamic-links-changed" text-children="Links">
  I've created these dynamic links for you, but I have to say they're not that exciting after all.
</scrip>


This Svelte component is a simple JavaScript application that dynamically updates the content of a SvelteKit component. The @sveltekit/dynamic-links-changed class creates an instance with the name "dynamic_links" and the current version as the name "dynamic_links".

To create an Svelte component that displays this code, you would typically want to use the following SvelteKit code:

svelte
<svelte-3 "/div",
   title@="Dynamic Links,
      <a href="#root" id="div2">Drag and Drop</a> - <a href="#link1" id="div4" /> A collection of links.</a>
<a href="#link2" id="div5" />


When you run this code, the Svelte component will display a link with the following content:

html
<!-- The div is below a button -->
links,
<scrip type="module":js->0>Drag and Drop system</a>.
<button href="#link3" class="s-fnd-styles">
  Link to <div id="div2">Dynamic Links</div>
<div id="div3"></div>,


To create an Svelte component that displays this code, you would typically want to use the following SvelteKit code:

svelte
<sveltekit-dynamic-links-changed @-svelte Kit "dynamic links" text "div 2"]


This is a very simple example of how to create a Svelte component. There are many ways to do this, including creating components from JavaScript files and then bundling those components into SvelteKit applications using the --build-assembly options.

If you want to use the --project-codepath option with SvelteKit, here is what it means:

svelte
<sveltekit-dynamic-links-changed @-svelte Kit "dynamic links" text a href>


The first step in creating this component would be to create an instance of SvelteKit. That can be done by reading the following Svelte 5 code.

Here is an example of how to do it:

svelte
<scrip type="module" s-compile="kit-dynamic-links-changed"
@text="dynamic links"
@build-assembly]


And this will display a link with the following content when you run it.

This is a simple Svelte component that demonstrates some basic concepts of Svelte. The purpose of Svelte is to create complex, dynamic and interactive web applications. Here's how to create one.
