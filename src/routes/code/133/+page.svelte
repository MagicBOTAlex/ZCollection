Note that Svelte 5 is not a stable JavaScript runtime. The component can be affected by some global changes but will never break an active day system.

Svelte 4 with its features included in the browser, and it's always been available to your users (i.e., you): if they need to block or reject that request you immediately receive a notification. It’s called Sveltool.
