	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a "Drag and Drop" system in Svelte 5 (the name you might give to the programming language that was once known as Sizzle). I'll use Sveltekit for this example.

svelte
import app from './app.svelte';

const MyComponent = {
  props: {
    actions: true,
    userEventActions: true,
},
actions: /* allow */ => ({
    titleEffect: { animate: 'flip', duration: 1000 },
}),
actions: app.user,
}
;


svelte
import state from './state.js";
app.state;


svelte
import action = (action);
app.action;


svelte
import actions = {
  titleEffect: { animate: 'flip' },
  onUserEvent = true,
};
actions.titleEffect();
actions.user !== undefined;
}
;


                `;
</script>
