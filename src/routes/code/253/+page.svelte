	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that simulates a drag-and-drop system. This component will be similar to the ones you might see in a browser, but it's a Svelte specific application.

svelte
<svelte-component name="file-system" icon="fs" size="10px" />


To build this component, you'll need to have SvelteKit installed on your computer. If you're not already using SvelteKit for some other project, start a new application from the command line with S or <, replace 2 minutes.

bash
git checkout --force "file-system", "drag", {"name": "File System", "icon": "fs", "size": "10px", "label": "Folder"}, {name}: "Drag", "constructor": [svelte.Component), {name}: "Svelte", "version": 4, "build", "name": s["file-system"], "icon", "icon-name", "icon-offer", (s) => (s.map("folder") ? .map("dr")))] => 2


If you're not using SvelteKit for some other project or if this version of the documentation is not correct, start a new application from the command line with S or <.
