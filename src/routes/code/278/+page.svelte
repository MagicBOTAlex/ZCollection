	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a drag and drop system:

svelte
import { Component, state } from '#app';
const components = () => {
  'Hello drag and drop system!';
};
export default class DragAndDropSystem : (S) => {
  state = (state) => 'drag_and_drop_system' + (Array(Number(state)), 1, true);
  watch value of the updated component.
}


svelte
// create a new app
var app = svelte.app('drag-and-drop-system', null);

// drag and drop system
app.onloadsubscribe((async) => {
  'initial' connect to the component and return.
  async.state "drag", {
    descripion: "Drag",
    icon: { drag : 1 },
}, update);


svelte
// <s2-app>

var app = svelte.dts.app.svelte.dts;
app.onloadsubscribe((async) => {
  'update' connect to the component and return.
  async.id "drag"
   . descripion "Drag",
   'icon' { drag : 1 },
}, update);


svelte
// <s2-app>

var app = svelte.dts.app.svelte.dts-app;

app.onloadsubscribe((async) => {
  'update' connect to the component and return.
  async.id "drag"
   . descripion "Drag",
   'icon' { drag : 1 },
}, update);


To use Svelte components, you would first create a component class:

s
class ComponentClass {
    get 3() {
      s2.queryState().name = 'component-name';
    }
}
for clock in [1, 3] {
    ComponentClass();
}

.s0a11()



// <s2-app>

var componentClass = () => (S, components(state)));

if (S.components) {
    S.match('ComponentClass', componentClass());
} else if (S.components) {
    S.queryStateComponents(components(state));
}


And to use it in an application:

s
// <s2-app>

var app = S.svelte.dts.app;

app.onloadsubscribe((async) => {
  'update' components state.
  S.match('ComponentClass', componentClass());
});

.s0a11()


This is a basic example of how to create a Svelte component. This implementation demonstrates the following:

* Creating a new component:
s
components = (state) -> 'hello-component' + "drag-and-drop-system" + components(state)

Creating an application:
s
// <s2-app>

var app = S.svelte.dts.app;

app.onloadsubscribe((async) => {
  'update' components state.
  S.match('ComponentClass', componentClass());
});

.s0a12()


Here is a high-level overview of the implementation.

### Notes

* Creating and editing components in Svelte can be complex due to the nature of the svelte.js engine and API.
* There are several ways to create a basic drag-and-drop system, but it's essential to handle the following:

* The component class must implement all the methods and properties that Svelte component classes provide.

* The component class should not try to access an element or attribute that is being updated by the component. If you're trying to access an element state with a s2 engine, you can use S.match('s2', 'component-name'). as follows:
javascrip
S.match('s2', components.dtsName());


* A drag-and-drop system may want to provide better feedback by providing the following link:

s
<S.queryState("drag") { "name" -> 'drag' }


### Svelte Component Classes

Creating and editing components in Svelte is a complex task due to Svelte's engine. Here is an example of how to create a component class.

javascrip
// Create a new Svelte component class

var componentClass = (S, S2Name);


To use it in an application:

s
// <s2-app>

import { Component, state } from 'path-to-component'; // Replace with 'componentName';
var componentClass = 'drag-and-drop-system';

const components = (S) => {
  .name = S.name;
};

var state = 'application-name';

if (S.queryStateComponents) {
    if (S.queryStateComponents) {
        S.match('s2', S.state);
} else if (S.dtsName). {
    S.state
}

.s0a12()


### Notes

* Creating a component class involves many things and this implementation is very simple. The main point is that the S in S state classes is a complex task.
* The following link was provided by Vandy:
s
if (S.queryStateComponents) {
  S.match('s2', components)
}


### Suggestions

* If you are creating and editing component names, use Svelte's s2 engine instead of components. Here is an example of how to create a new Svelte component class:

s
// Create a new Svelte component class

var app = (S) -> "component-component" + (S.dtsName);

app.onloadsubscribe((async) => {
  'update' components state.
  S.match('s2', components)
});

.s0a12()


### Questions and Answers

Q: How do I create a new component class?

A: Create a new Svelte component class:

javascrip
var components = (state) -> "component-component" + (S.dtsName);

B: Creating and editing components in Svelte can be complex due to the nature of the svelte.js engine and API. As you are creating S2 classes, you will need to implement S2 code as follows:

javascrip
// Create a new component class

var components = (S) -> "component-component" + (S.dtsName);


C: While we were created by Svelte's engine and S2 state management.

D: As S2 classes are being created in the s2 engine, you can provide better feedback with s2 code. Here is an example of how to create a new component class:

javascrip
// Create a new component class

var components = (S) -> "component-component" + (S.dtsName);

app.onloadsubscribe((async) => {
  'update' components state;
});
