	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component that simulates a drag and drop system.

svelte
<scrip lang="sl-2") {
  <input typeof="object" "label" "label" "input"> { "label": label }
}


svelte
<svelte-dnd/>,
<iframe embed={{"style", "width", "speed"}} src={{"style", "style"}} frameborder={{"style", "style"}, "width", "width", "color", "rgb", "black", "v", "vs", "name", "x", "y", "scroll", {"style", "style"}}) {{ "style", "style", "label": label }}></iframe>
</svelte-dnd/>


Here is an example of a Svelte component that simulates a drag and drop system. This component has two inputs: addWeight and addSpeed.

svelte
<scrip lang="sl-3"> { "addWeight", "label": "addColor" } for use</scrip>

<svelte-dnd/>,
<svelte-dnd/>,


Here is a simple Svelte component that simulates a drag and drop system. It has two inputs: dragText and handle.

svelte
<scrip lang="sl-2"> {
  "label": "dragLabel",
} for use</scrip>

<svelte-dnd/>,
<svelte-dnd/>,


This is how you might build a application. The Svelte components are called, parameters passed to them, and the JavaScript files were probably initialized as well as being saved.

Please note that Svelte was not originally designed or built by teams; many of whom are now on board with the project.
