	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a sample implementation of a Svelte component that mimics the classic drag-and-drop system.

svelte
<scrip lang="module"] {
  self.id = "my_component";

  mounted() { // This is a built-in Svelte event handler.
  if (window.location.origin) {
    window.location.origin = 'application://drag';
  } else {
    window.location.origin = 'application://drag';
  }
}


html>
.drag-system
{
    descripion = "A classic drag-and-drop system where you can easily copy and paste items."
},
descripion = "A drag system that allows dragging.",
}


svelte
<scrip lang="module"] {
  { browserHistory() }

  onMount() {
    if (window.location.origin) {
      window.location.origin = 'application://drag';
    } else {
      window.location.origin = 'application://drag';
    }
  },


You can run this Svelte component as an application. Open a web browser, navigate to <your/site>:/applications, and use the following HTML snippet in your browser:

html>
<scrip lang="module"] { "Application://drag" }

desc = "A classic drag system where you can easily copy and paste items."

},
descripion = "A basic drag system."
}


To run this component, save it as a Svelte application. Open the following HTML snippet in your browser:

html>
<scrip lang="module"] {
  { appHistory() }
}

desc = "Open to the web developer, but also a bit of complexity and security issues."

},
descripion = "A basic drag system where you are dragging."}

This is how you can use Svelte components.
