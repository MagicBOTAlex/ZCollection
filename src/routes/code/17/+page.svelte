	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a basic drag and drop system.

svelte
<scrip, engine="v4" target="$root"></scrip>
<scrip, engine="v3" target="$root"></scrip>


Note: If you are using the latest version of Svelte (version 1.0 to version 2.50), the component above will throw an error due to the changes in svelte.dts). This has been made possible by adding a new feature called svelte 5.

bash
<scrip, target="$root"></scrip>


To implement this Svelte component and try to run it on the Svelte version of "BETA" as an example.

Please note that you will need to install the following package in your dependencies or packages:

@svelte@0.4 <= 1.5 >= 2.6, where 3 = 7

bash
--package "@svelte@0.4" < "0.4" to "1.5" "2.6"> -karmal@-v=1; -- npm build -> . - k --port < target >


You can install the following package in your dependencies or packages:

bash
--npm install karmal@-v 1;
--npm pkg


To use this Svelte component and try to run it on the Svelte version of "BETA" as an example.

bash
--app app


This is how you implement a drag and drop system in Svelte.
