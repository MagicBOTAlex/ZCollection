	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how you could create a Svelte component for a drag and drop system:

svelte
<svelte-component name="drag-dropping" descripion="A simple drag and drop system."

  @action "drag a file" { action 'name' }


In this code, the @action statement is used to define an action. The action.name variable is set to the specified string.

Note: Svelte 5 has undergone significant changes compared to its previous versions due to numerous edge cases introduced and the introduction of a few features that have been added in recent time but are still being added constantly from Svelte version 3 onwards.

Svelte 5 can compile this component.
