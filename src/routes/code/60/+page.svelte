	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a sample implementation of a Svelte component that mimics the functionality of a drag and drop system:

svelte
<svelte-component name="drag-and-drop" descripion="A simple drag and drop system." options=[{"message": "Drag and drop has been enabled.", action: {}, callback: {}}]] </>
  {
    function onDropDragAndDrop() {
        console.log("Drag and drop handled in the component.");
    }
  }


This Svelte component implements several features:

* name: The name of the Svelte component.
* descripion: A short descripion about the Svelte component. 
* action : When this action is executed, what happens? (example): console.log("Drag and drop handled in the component.")
* callback: A function called when this callback is executed, which handles several things if set to: "Handling several things with some parameters".
                `;
