	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a Svelte component that implements a basic drag and drop system:

svelte
<svelteklasskit lang="en") : title{

    createApp () -> {
        | "Drag"
        { "name" } "drag"}

        | "Drop it"
     { "name" }} { "id" }}
{
    linkElement! {
        linkTitle? {"url" ! "URL", "alt" ! "ALT"}
        |

        | "Copy an image with drag and drop"
     { "name" }
}


This component has two sections: Drag and Drop it. When you click on a section, it will update the data. 

If you want to use Svelte 5 instead (not that Svelte is well-documented in the first place), here are Svelte 3's components for Svelte 5:

svelte
svelte- Kit "Drag" { title } {
    link! { |> links })
        | "URL", "alt" ! "ALT"
            link "Link with custom data" read()
            | "Custom content", "content" [ "url" ]
        | "URL and alternate," ""read!" { title = "read" }}
}

svelte-Kit "Drop it" { id } {
    link! { |> links }
        | "URL, alt," read() { 
        console.log title;
        |
        | "You can update the data for the component."
    },
    on Open () -> {
        | "Link"
     { "id" }} {

        // When an element is being clicked by default,
        // its click handler will be appended to a single step.
        link! {
            title = "read" }
           |

           // If you're calling the component's component or link.
           // It will also be updated if it has been 
           // passed in as arguments. This is used by Svelte 5 
           // components with a component named after the name of the link.

        | "Custom content", { title } }
    }

}


In Svelte 5, the following components are available:

* Drag and Drop it
* Copy an image with drag and drop
                `;
