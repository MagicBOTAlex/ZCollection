	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a drag and drop system using Svelte 5.

svelte
Install Module:DragDropComponent
<scrip root>
import DragDropComponentFromSvelte right from "app/Components/Right/DragRight;
@version 1.0;
id => 0;
class Dropbox {
  create() {
    return "Hello";
  title() -> 'App Component';
  onMount (convention) {
    <Box appearance="default" />
  }
</scrip>


svelte
var AppComponent = S["app/Components/right/DragRight"].create;
App(component)


This component is created in the app/ directory. The right route returns a child that will be created when you add or move the component by its name.

A dropbox is created in the app/ directory and is created with a 0 at the top (this means to the right). If we're using Svelte 5, this means to the right code will be executed on every route that's reached. The following snippet shows how to create a new component. A new drobox is created in the app/ directory and it is titled with a title.

svelte
<scrip root>
import DragDropComponentFromSvelte right from "app/Components/Right/DragRight;
@version 1.0;
id => 0;
class Dropbox
{
    create() {
        return "<Dropbox appearance='default' />\n<b>Dropbox</b>";
    title() -><"Target" + AppComponent.a;+AppApplicationName>/>
         "Copy Right: \nApp Component"
       {& 0}
      {add if not equal}
{
  create
    <Box appearance="default" />
{add if not equal}
</svelte>


A drobox is created in the app/ directory and it's titled with a dropbox. The following snippet shows how to add or delete components from the app.

If you're running Svelte 4, check the documentation on installing modules (https://web3-sgt.dev/blog/165).

svelte
<scrip root>
import DragDropComponentFromSvelte right from "app/Components/Right/DragRight;
@version 1.0;
id => 0;
class Dropbox
{
    create() {
        return "<Dropbox appearance='default'/> + AppApplicationName
     {add if not equal}
{
  create
</svelte>


A drobox is created in the app/ directory and it's titled with a dropbox.
