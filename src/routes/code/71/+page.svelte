	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a Svelte component that mimics the classic drag-and-drop file transfer system:

dart
import { Component, track } from "svelte5-d Dart";

// class DragBox {
// @dart(0x1) // TODO
class _ {
  noGettonck() {
    yield [/* "Drag this" ] 'title;
  }
}


This component uses Svelte's track function to handle DOM changes, making it compatible with Svelte 5.

Note that Svelte is no longer widely used in modern web development. However, for the time of Svelte 4 and now (2020), Svelte was still being actively developed; since then it has been largely considered an older version of Svelte.
