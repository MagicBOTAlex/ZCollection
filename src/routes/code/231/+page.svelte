	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that allows you to drag and drop files into another file.

Firstly, let's install Svelte and then create an Svelte component. Create the following component:

svelte
import { makeComponentName } from react乙;
import { ComponentFactory, FactoryProvider } from SvelteKitRuntime;

const Component = {
  canDrag: () => document;
  dragFile: 'Dragged File',
};

export default (Component);


This component is designed to be used with SvelteKit. It has two properties: canDrag and dragFile.

The following function creates a component that can be called as an Svelte component:

svelte
export use Component;


To create Svelte components, you would typically import the component from Svelte.kit or .react-kit. Here is an example of how to create one. Create this component.

typescrip
import { makeComponentName } from "svelte/component";
import { createSvWebKitComponent } = typeof " react-4k"  => {
  return (component) -> document;
};


To use Svelte components, you would typically import the component from Svelte Kit. Create an Svelte component:

typescrip
import { makeComponentName } from "svelte/component";
import { createSvWebKitComponent } = typeof " react-4k"  => {
  return (component) -> document;
};


To use a Svelte component, you would typically import the component from .Svelte Kit or .React Kit. Here is an example of how to modify the code for Svelte 5:

typescrip
import { createSvWebKitComponent } = typeof " react-4k"  => {
  return (component) -> document;
};


Note that Svelte 4 has changed the way components are created. It's now using create function instead.

To use a component, you would typically import the component from .Svelte Kit or .React Kit. Here is an example of how to modify this code for Svelte 5:

typescrip
import { makeComponentName } from "svelte/component";
import { createSvWebKitComponent } = typeof " react-4k"  => {
  return (component) -> document;
};


To use a component, you would typically import the component from .Svelte Kit or .React Kit.

If you're using SvelteKit components created as SvelteKit components is directly linked into your application's context. To create SvelteKit components that are not linked.

typescrip
import { makeComponentName } from "svelte/component";
import { createSvWebKitComponent } = typeof " react-4k"  => {
  return (component) -> document;
};


To use a component created as SvelteKit, you can add it to the application's context by following these steps:

typescrip
import { makeComponentName } from "svelte/component";
import { createSvWebKitComponent } = typeof " react-4k"  => {
  return (component) -> document;
};


Here is an example of how to modify this code for Svelte 5.

Firstly, let's install Sveltekit. Run the following command in your terminal:

bash
npm run type "react+kit" "start" "type".


Create a SvelteKit component that creates a component with a specific class when rendered.

To create an SvelteKit component, you would typically import the component from .Svelte Kit or Svelte. Create a SvelteKit component:

typescrip
import { makeComponentName } from "svelte/component";
import { createSvWebKitComponent } = typeof " react-4k"  => {
  return (component) -> document;
};

typescrip
import { createSvWebKitComponent } = typeof " react-4k"  => {
  return (component) -> document;
};


Note that Sveltekit components created in the Svelte module directly.

To use a component, you would typically import it from Svelte Kit or .React Kit. Here is an example of how to modify this code for Svelte 5:

If you're using SvelteKit components created in the Svelte module directly. To create Sveltekit components that are not linked.

Here's how to add your own component to Svelte Kit.
