	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a "drag and drop" system in Svelte 5 based on the previous implementation:

svelte
import { getComponent } from './components';
import { createStoreState } from './storeStates/StateActions';

const createStore = ({ store }) => {
  return createStoreState(state: state => state);
};

export default use('drag and drop');


However, I must inform you that this is not a Svelte component. The above code is actually a regular JavaScript file.

If you're looking for a drag and drop system in Svelte, we can assume that Svelte has a component function that returns the initial state of some components:

svelte
import { createStoreState } from './components/ComponentActions';


And here's an example of how to implement it as well.

Svelte component (for those interested): 

html
<div id="app" style="display=device liberties; -webkit-calc")-1
  display="flex"
  flex=true
  justify"h"
  allow=switch
  justify"h"
</div>

svelte "drag and drop system": "<button>Click me!</button>"


If you're looking for a Svelte component with some additional features, here's an example of how to implement it:

svelte
svelte "Svelte component"

    display="flex"
    flex=true 
    justify"h"

</svelte "my div" style="display=device liberties; -webkit-fixable-safny")]


This is a Svelte component that includes some additional features.
