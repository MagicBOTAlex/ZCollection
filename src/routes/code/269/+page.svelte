	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that demonstrates a simple drag and drop system:

svelte
<svelte-component name="Drag" importArgs="drag" exportValueArgs=["name"]=";></svelte>

<svelte-component name="Drop" importArgs=["name"]=";loadingArgs="";;attr.0="display:drop";
  importArgs;
  exportValueArgs];
{/svelte}

<svelte-component name="Copy" importArgs["copy"]{"default": "copy", "label": ""};">Drag</svelte-component>
{/svelte}


This component includes the following elements:

* name: displays a copy of yourself; display name: shows your current display
* name: displays an item of data in your current display. You can use the command to specify its value and display name.
* drag : shows the items for a specific action that appears below, or above a different element by which you are able to narrow down what you're doing by showing elements is easier if you have a list
+ 0: displays the content of the importArgs. If your array was empty then it will simply show your default value.
×

* copy : shows the copy of yourself that appears when the command is being used to display. You can use the command to specify its label and display name.
