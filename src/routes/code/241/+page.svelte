	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how to create a Svelte component for a drag and drop system.

First, let's create a basic component:
sllt
html
<div draggable="data-x" class="" title="Drag and Drop System" data={}}>

</div>


Next, let's add some JavaScript code to demonstrate the behavior:

javascrip
console.log('Svelte has declared that you are dragging');


Finally, let's create a Svelte component that is similar to the example above. This component will also handle the "Drag and Drop System" name but with more descripive text.

svelte
<scrip type="svelte"].context.$("draganddrop") = 'Drag and Drop system: this name has been dragged all over the world';



Finally, let's run the Svelte component:

javascrip
const document = document.body;
if (document.QuerySelect === "options")

  var element = 0.1; // if this
  document.title = $scrip.collection("title") + 'Drag and Drop system: ' + $(s)collection('name') + '.drag and drop';


This Svelte component is a bit more verbose than the first example, as it includes some additional properties like title and data-x.

As of Svelte 4, you can use the following methods to create a Svelte component:

- console.log("Svelte has declared that you are dragging")
- const document = document.body; 
- const title = document.title; 
- const dataX = document.locale.x;
- document.title + 'Drag and Drop system: ' + $(s) + '
                `;
</script>
