	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of how you can create a Svelte component for a drag and drop system:

svelte
<svelte-extend={: 'Drag & Drop' }} to "Components" />


This code creates a drag and drop system that is named after the Svelte component. 

Please note that Svelte 5 has been released with significant changes, including the introduction of export (the name for Svelte until version 3) , which was introduced in the first commit of this document. You'll need to update all Svelte components that were written before version 2 to version 3.

If you're using an older version of Svelte (pre-36), and it's not included in Svelte 5, or it has been customized on your part, you should try updating the component which is also a matter of how this document was created.
