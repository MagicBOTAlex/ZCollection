	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is an example of a Svelte component that implements a drag and drop system with Svelte.

svelte
<svelte-component name="drag-and-drop-system" descripion="A component that provides a drag and drop experience"] {}


To write this Svelte component, we would need to implement the features of Svelte in our language. Here is an example implementation:

svelte
<scrip root>
  export var DragAndDropSystem = svelte#components.draganddrop;
  $(history).component("drag-dnd), "version");
</scrip>


In this code, we define a new component called drag-dnd and its first version to be the same as Svelte's components. You can add your own customizations like you want.

This is a very simple example of how to implement some drag and drop system in Svelte.
