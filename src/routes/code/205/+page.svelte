	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component for a "Drag and Drop" system:

svelte
<div class="drag-drop" on-drag-select-click>

# drag text
Drag Text
</div>


And here's an example of how to structure the code. You'll need to add two elements: drop. I assume you're using Svelte 5; here is a basic implementation for Svelte 4:

svelte
<svelte-struct.drag-drop
  title="Drag and Drop"
    on-drag-select-click
    "Click me to open the app in new window, so you can open it in different colors."
</svelte-struct>


Here's a basic implementation for Svelte 5. You're already done with this.

If that is not enough, then follow up here:

svelte
<SvelteComponent name="drag-drop", desc="Drag and Drop")

  div

    <div class="modal-close-modal" on-click-select-show>
      Click me to open the app in new windows, so you can open it in different colors.
    </div>

    a<div class="modal-open" on-click-select-show="openModal">click here</a></div>


Here is an example of how to structure the code. You'll need to add two elements: svelte-component and modal-close-modal. Here are both in Svelte 4:

svelte
<svelte-struct.drag-drop
  on-click-select-show="selectModal"
  div

    <div class="open modalClose", on-key-closed="selectModal">

      click me to open the app in new windows, so you can use it.
    </div>

    <a name="modalClose" onclick="selectModal(openModal))"
       "Click me to open the app in new windows, so you can select it."
    </a>
  </div>
</svelte-struct>


Here is an example of how to structure the code. You will need two elements: svelte-component and modalClose. Here are both in Svelte 5:

svelte
<svelte-struct.drag-drop

  <on-click selectShow="selectDrop"]

    Click me to open the app, so you can use it.

</svelte-struct>


I hope this helps! Let's make a component that could be used as an application.
