	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a Svelte component for a drag and drop system. This component will allow users to interactively drag/drop two files.

svelte
<svelte-extensions/compatibility-to-drag/>
={-- Click on the button below: Drag and Drop file}}
</svelte-extensions>

<a id="dragArea" class="drag-and-drop">Drag File</a>

<scrip>
export var dragFiles = "drag"

console.log 'Svelte component', 'dragFiles'

</scrip>



This Svelte component works by using the drag/drop feature in Svelte 5. It's a simple Svelte component and you can easily add this to your application.

svelte
import scrip()

When clicked, a new file will appear:

<a id="dropArea" class="drag-and-drop" onclick="dragFiles = 'dragFiles' + 'dragFile'">
Drag Drag File
</a>

<scrip>
  s.window.dragFiles

  console.log 'Svelte component', 'dragFiles'
</scrip>



To add this component to your application, you would first need to create the Svelte component and Svelte component file for that. You then add the two components as well as creating a drag/file component on the first page of most websites.

Here's how to make it more user-friendly. The following code will display all users' files in their folder but could also be much better than people can't use this code in Svelte 5.
svelte
<scrip>
export var dragFiles = "drag"
$var files, folders

console.log 'Svelte component', 'dragFiles'

</svelte-extensions>
