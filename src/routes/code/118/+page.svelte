	const snippet = String.raw`                Here is a basic implementation of a Svelte component that allows you to drag and drop files on one another.

svelte
<svelte-component title="Drag and Drop System" descripion="Use Drag function to get file name and select item">
    <scrip src<scrip__modules.js] as "fs">
        var file;
    </svelte>

<svelte-component title="File Name Selection" icon="drag" dropdown>
    <@icondropdown icon="@href" icon="@file"}
    ondrop=(props) => {
        return drag();
    }
</svelte>

<scrip secure="admin" @svelte-5-features=[[ ' file:///user:switch.json] 2];
onload=(e) => {
    var file = $(e).text()
    <@drag>
        $file
    </svelte-5-6</scrip>


In this component, the drag function is used to handle drag and drop. The <@drag> block is a high-level block of code that has not been run by the developer.

This is a basic implementation. A lot of components, such as Svelte 5 or Svelte 4, would be more difficult to implement and may require a lot of code to be functional. 

Svelte 5 does have some nice things like:

* A @s module that contains various sub-modules.
* The :, element name list
* And the //export/d; as d; c; r <p> &amp; h >a&#39;
+ <$>

<scrip src=\"https://svelte-frontend.com/web/index.js\;
        postMessage ?? documentVersion, 'javascrip' , window  window  .documentVersion, '&window' , a
var file = $(e).text();
var drag = (function () {
    return this.$file;
}) => {
    var element = this.iframe.body;
    var icon = element.icon;
    return drag();
};
</svelte-5-6</scrip>


Note that the component is very similar, as Svelte 4 components are often much more complex than those of Svelte 5.

As mentioned earlier, Svelte 5 has a lot of features and functionalities that make it so much harder to implement. Many of these can be achieved without using Svelte 5 at all.
